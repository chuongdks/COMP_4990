```ruby
class MyClass

3106452,java servlet instantiation and session variables,"Out of curiosity and naivety:

Suppose, I have a webserver which holds numerous servlets. For information passing among those servlets I am getting the servlet context and setting session variables. Now, if 2 or more users send request to this server then what happens to the session variables? Will they all be common for all the users or they will be different for each user. If they are different, then how was the server able to differentiate between different users?

One more similar questions,
If there are n users accessing a particular servlet, then this servlet gets instantiated only the first time the first user accessed it or it gets instantiated for all the users separately?

Thanks,",<servlets>,"Clarification on Servlet Instantiation and Session Variable Behavior in Java Web Applications

_","I am seeking clarification regarding the behavior of servlets and session management in Java web applications. Specifically:

1. When multiple users send requests to a web server hosting several servlets, and these servlets utilize the ServletContext and session variables for data sharing, how does the server handle session variables? Are they shared across all users or are they unique per user? If they are unique, how does the server differentiate between different users' sessions?

2. Regarding servlet instantiation: If multiple users access a particular servlet, is the servlet instantiated only once when the first user accesses it, or is a new instance created for each user?  

Any detailed explanation on how servlet instantiation and session management work in this context would be appreciated.

How to Remove an Element from a Python Dictionary and Return the Modified Dictionary

_","_
I'm working with a Python dictionary and need to remove a specific element. While I know I can use the `.pop()` method to remove an element, it returns the value of the removed item, which isn't exactly what I need. Instead, I want a way to obtain a new dictionary that contains all the original elements except the one I want to remove, without modifying the original dictionary.

Currently, I have a helper function that takes the original dictionary as a parameter and returns a new dictionary with the specified element removed. I'm wondering if there's a more elegant or idiomatic way in Python to achieve this without explicitly copying and filtering the dictionary each time.

Any suggestions or best practices for this?
