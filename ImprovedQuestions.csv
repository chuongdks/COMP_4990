90178,Make a div fill the remaining screen space,"I am currently working on a web application, where I want the content to fill the entire screen. I have a header `div` and a content `div`. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:

CSS:

    #page {
      height: 100%;
    }
    #tdcontent {
      height: 100%;
    }

HTML:

    <table id=""page"">
      <tr><td id=""tdheader"">
        <div id=""header"">...</div>
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td id=""tdcontent>
        <div id=""content"">...</div>
      </td>
    </table>

Which works how I like. The table remains at 100%, and the `tdcontent` element is always less than 100%. Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the `table`?",<table><css><html>,How to Make a Div Fill Remaining Screen Space Without Using Tables,"I'm developing a web application where I want a content `div` to occupy the remaining vertical space of the viewport after a header.

3106452,java servlet instantiation and session variables,"Out of curiosity and naivety:

Suppose, I have a webserver which holds numerous servlets. For information passing among those servlets I am getting the servlet context and setting session variables. Now, if 2 or more users send request to this server then what happens to the session variables? Will they all be common for all the users or they will be different for each user. If they are different, then how was the server able to differentiate between different users?

One more similar questions,
If there are n users accessing a particular servlet, then this servlet gets instantiated only the first time the first user accessed it or it gets instantiated for all the users separately?

Thanks,",<servlets>,Understanding Servlet Instantiation and Session Variable Behavior in Java Web Applications,"I am working with a Java web server that hosts multiple servlets. I have a few questions regarding how session management and servlet instantiation work in this environment:

1. When multiple users send requests to the server, and I store data in session variables via the servlet context, are these session variables shared across all users or are they unique per user? How does the server distinguish between different users to maintain separate session data?

2. Regarding servlet instantiation: if multiple users access a particular servlet, is the servlet instantiated only once (e.g., on the first user request), or is a new instance created for each user? How does the server manage servlet instances in this context?

Any clarification on how session variables and servlet instantiation are handled in Java servlets would be appreciated.",<servlets><session-management><servlet-instances>

I'm following the Git Immersion tutorial (http://gitimmersion.com/) to learn Git, and I encounter an issue when using `git log`.

I cannot type commands or continue with my workflow, and I end up closing and reopening Git Bash.
