90178,Make a div fill the remaining screen space,"I am currently working on a web application, where I want the content to fill the entire screen. I have a header `div` and a content `div`. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:

CSS:

    #page {
      height: 100%;
    }
    #tdcontent {
      height: 100%;
    }

HTML:

    <table id=""page"">
      <tr><td id=""tdheader"">
        <div id=""header"">...</div>
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td id=""tdcontent>
        <div id=""content"">...</div>
      </td>
    </table>

Which works how I like. The table remains at 100%, and the `tdcontent` element is always less than 100%. Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the `table`?",<table><css><html>,How to Make a Div Fill Remaining Screen Space Without Using Tables,"I'm developing a web application and want the main content area to fill the remaining vertical space of the viewport, below a header.

}
#tdcontent {

2709821,python 'self' explained,"What is the purpose of the 'self' word in python. I understand it refers to the specific object created from that class, but i cant see why it explicitly needs to be added to very function as a parameter. To illustrate, in ruby, i could do this:

_","I'm trying to understand the role of the 'self' parameter in Python class methods. I know that 'self' refers to the specific instance of the class, but I'm unclear on why it needs to be explicitly included as the first parameter in every method.

```ruby
class MyClass

3106452,java servlet instantiation and session variables,"Out of curiosity and naivety:

Suppose, I have a webserver which holds numerous servlets. For information passing among those servlets I am getting the servlet context and setting session variables. Now, if 2 or more users send request to this server then what happens to the session variables? Will they all be common for all the users or they will be different for each user. If they are different, then how was the server able to differentiate between different users?

One more similar questions,
If there are n users accessing a particular servlet, then this servlet gets instantiated only the first time the first user accessed it or it gets instantiated for all the users separately?

Thanks,",<servlets>,Understanding Servlet Instantiation and Session Variable Behavior in Java Web Applications,"I'm working with a Java web server that hosts multiple servlets. I have a few questions regarding how session management and servlet instantiation work:

1. When multiple users send requests to the server, and I store data in session variables via the servlet context, are these session variables shared across all users or are they unique per user? How does the server differentiate between different users to ensure session data remains separate?

2. Regarding servlet instantiation: if multiple users access the same servlet, is the servlet instantiated only once (the first time any user accesses it), or is a new instance created for each user? How does the server manage servlet instances in this context?

How to Remove an Element from a Python Dictionary Without Modifying the Original

_","_
I'm looking for a way to delete an element from a Python dictionary without altering the original dictionary. I know that calling `.pop()` or `del` will modify the dictionary in place and return the removed element, but I want to obtain a new dictionary that excludes the specified key, leaving the original unchanged.

Currently, I have a helper function that takes the original dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary with the specified element removed. However, I'm wondering if there's a more elegant or built-in way to achieve this, perhaps using dictionary comprehensions or other Python features.

Could someone suggest a clean and efficient method to create a modified copy of a dictionary with certain keys removed, without mutating the original?
