"90178","2008-09-18 05:06:17","Initial Body","I am currently working on a web application, where I want the content to fill the entire screen. I have a header `div` and a content `div`. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:

CSS:

    #page {
      height: 100%;
    }
    #tdcontent {
      height: 100%;
    }

HTML:

    <table id=""page"">
      <tr><td id=""tdheader"">
        <div id=""header"">...</div>
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td id=""tdcontent>
        <div id=""content"">...</div>
      </td>
    </table>

Which works how I like. The table remains at 100%, and the `tdcontent` element is always less than 100%. Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the `table`?"

Suppose, I have a webserver which holds numerous servlets. For information passing among those servlets I am getting the servlet context and setting session variables. Now, if 2 or more users send request to this server then what happens to the session variables? Will they all be common for all the users or they will be different for each user. If they are different, then how was the server able to differentiate between different users?

If there are n users accessing a particular servlet, then this servlet gets instantiated only the first time the first user accessed it or it gets instantiated for all the users separately?

How can I sort this array by the date element in order from the date closest to the current date and time down? Keep in mind that the array may have many objects, but for the sake of simplicity I used 2.

Would I use the sort function and a custom comparator?"

In my specific case, I wanted the dates arranged from the most recent to the oldest. It ended up that I had to reverse the simple function's logic as so:

    array.sort(function(a, b) {
		a = new Date(a.dateModified);
