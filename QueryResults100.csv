5243486,3/9/2011 9:10,Initial Body,"All,

We were using NHiberate 2.1 where we are storing decimal values (exchange rates) e.g. 123.1234567 to 7 decimal places

We are mapping the type using default mapping style:

    <property name=""ExchangeRate""  not-null=""true"" />

However when we upgrade to NHibernate 3.0 the value above is saved as 123.1234500.

It does not specify this change in behaviour in the 3.0 release notes although it does seem to detail that in issue [NH-1594], the default value for decimal is DECIMAL(19,5)

We have a solution i.e. specify the following mapping:

    <property name=""ExchangeRate""  type=""decimal(10,7) not-null=""true"" />


I need to know is this solution the right way to solve this issue?
Also, why is there a functional change in behaviour with rounding between 2.1 and 3.0?

Cheers,

Billy Stack"

16282395,4/29/2013 15:22,Initial Body,"I am working on an assignment which requires the use of A* algorithm but I cannot figure out how.

The assignment is, imagine a postman sending parcels on a grid map from `(0,0)` to infinity. He takes a list of tasks at the beginning of a day, with each task assigned a starting point `(x1,y1)` and an ending point `(x2,y2)`. Since he cannot handle two tasks at the same time, he will have to arrange those tasks, so that when he finishes one task and move from the end point to the next start point, he could have the minimum travelling distance during the whole day. The distance is calculated as Manhattan distance which is `d(x1,y1,x2,y2) = abs(x2 - x1) + abs(y2 - y1)`.

sample input:

    Job 3 3 to 5 3        # there is a job from (3,3) to (5,3)
    Job 1 1 to 9 2        # there is a job from (1,1) to (9,2)
    Job 3 5 to 2 7        # there is a job from (3,5) to (2,7)
    Job 5 5 to 5 7        # there is a job from (5,5) to (5,7)

sample output:

    n nodes explored
    cost = 31
    Move from 0 0 to 1 1
    Carry from 1 1 to 9 2
    Move from 9 2 to 3 3
    Carry from 3 3 to 5 3
    Move from 5 3 to 5 5
    Carry from 5 5 to 5 7
    Move from 5 7 to 3 5
    Carry from 3 5 to 2 7

In my point of view, though a graph(or map) is mentioned here, it is not required since the only essential part is to sort those tasks for a minimum while the distance can be easily calculated. Something stupid would be permutation and select the one with the least cost but never to adopt that. I have also tried Greedy but it may not get the global best solution.

So the question is, since A* algo. is designed for path finding, how can we apply that or a variation of that to this problem of finding the correct way?"

21287078,1/22/2014 15:28,Initial Body,"I'm trying to build a reusable directive that shows a dialog box when a button is clicked and allows the user to customize an array of strings. I have this working fine, but I'm trying to figure out if I can swap out data binding through code, so that I can use this directive multiple times with different arrays of strings.

In my HTML, I have the directive:

`<my-array-dialog control='arrayDialog'></my-array-dialog>`

I'm exposing a shared control object with a showDialog method on it that causes the dialog to be shown. An example of that pattern is: http://plnkr.co/edit/MqN9yS8R5dnqTfjqldwX?p=preview

What I want to do is have two-way data-binding with the parent controller passing in the data into my showDialog method. I'm unsure how to configure this though, or even if it is possible.

In my directive, I have the following:

    $scope.control = {
        showDialog: function (arrayData) {
            $scope.arrayData= arrayData;
        }
    }

Ideally, changes to `$scope.arrayData` would be reflected in the calling code's arrayData. Again, the reason I'm not setting this up as an attribute is because I want to call this dialog multiple times with different data and to avoid having multiple dialog directives.

Is it possible to set up the two-way data binding in this manner, or am I going about this all wrong?"

I am trying to compile from source the **libgcrypt** library from GNU on a mac running OS X 10.9.4. I need to compile to a 32 bit binary which I will later use lipo to blend with the 64 bit one (I have the 64 bit part working).  I am trying to be able to reference the libgcrypt binary from both 32 and 64 bit programs. Link here:   http://www.gnu.org/software/libgcrypt/

I have a filter on my xamarin app to get the profile, and it works well but I need to include the ""children"" (linked) docs... I can do this with a view setting include_docs=true but I want couchdb to filter so I can use replication. 
Also, it would be possible to accomplish the same result if I could use a reduce function to filter data, but I can't make the filter use the reduce function.. So, any idea?

the expected result would be: 

doc profile

            xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""

        <ContentControl cal:View.Model=""{Binding ActiveItem}"" />
        
    </Window>

Which is used at runtime with the following ViewModel:

    public class MyShellViewModel : ShellViewModel // derrived from own base class
    {
        public MyShellViewModel(IThemeManager themeManager)
            : base(themeManager)
        {
        }
    }

but the view should bind against this ViewModel at design time in the namespace DesignData:

    public sealed class DesignShellViewModel : Conductor<IScreen>.Collection.OneActive
    {
        public DesignShellViewModel()
        {
            AssemblySource.Instance.Add(this.GetType().Assembly);
    
            this.ActivateItem(new TestViewModel());
        }
    }

This is a simple conductor containing a single sreen (a TestViewModel)
in the Test.DesignData namespace:

    public class TestViewModel : Screen
    {
    // nothing interesting to see here
    }

and corresponding view

    <UserControl x:Class=""Test.DesignData.Views.TestView""
                 xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""

I want to enable DesignTime support as documented [here][1] for my Window that contains a single ContentControl:

    <Window x:Class=""Test.MyShellView""
            xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
            xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""
            xmlns:cal=""http://www.caliburnproject.org""
            xmlns:i=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/2010/interactivity""
            xmlns:mc=""http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006""
            xmlns:d=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008""
            xmlns:viewModels=""clr-namespace:Test.DesignData.ViewModels""
            mc:Ignorable=""d""
            ResizeMode=""CanResizeWithGrip""
            d:DataContext=""{d:DesignInstance Type=viewModels:DesignShellViewModel, IsDesignTimeCreatable=True}""
            cal:Bind.AtDesignTime=""True"">
        
           
        <ContentControl cal:View.Model=""{Binding ActiveItem}"" />
        
    </Window>

Which is used at runtime with the following ViewModel:

    public class MyShellViewModel : ShellViewModel // derrived from own base class
    {
        public MyShellViewModel(IThemeManager themeManager)
            : base(themeManager)
        {
        }
    }

but the view should bind against this ViewModel at design time in the namespace DesignData:

    public sealed class DesignShellViewModel : Conductor<IScreen>.Collection.OneActive
    {
        public DesignShellViewModel()
        {
            AssemblySource.Instance.Add(this.GetType().Assembly);
    
            this.ActivateItem(new TestViewModel());
        }
    }

This is a simple conductor containing a single sreen (a TestViewModel)
in the Test.DesignData namespace:

    public class TestViewModel : Screen
    {
    // nothing interesting to see here
    }

and corresponding view

    <UserControl x:Class=""Test.DesignData.Views.TestView""
                 xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
                 xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""
                 xmlns:mc=""http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"" 
                 xmlns:d=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"" 
                 mc:Ignorable=""d"" 
                 d:DesignHeight=""300"" d:DesignWidth=""300"">
        <Grid>
            <TextBlock VerticalAlignment=""Center"" HorizontalAlignment=""Center"">It's working at design time!</TextBlock>
        </Grid>
    </UserControl>

Anyone who knows what the problem might be?


**Edit: Posts by mvermef brought me closer to a solution (I think)**

Now appears a message that Caliburn is unable to find the View for the ViewModel (like it did at runtime, when name is wrong or class not found/missing... but it is there in the same library).

Here is a part of my *Bootstrapper* as asked by @mvermef:

    // nothing special here, is empty... just a concrete class to create it via Xaml
    public class Bootstrapper : Bootstrapper<IShell>
    {
    }

    // contains the important parts (Autofac, MEF integration etc.)
    public class Bootstrapper<TViewModel> : BootstrapperBase
    {
        // I use Common.Logging
        private static readonly ILog Log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(Bootstrapper<TViewModel>));

        // the Autofac container
        private IContainer container;

        static Bootstrapper()
        {
            // Redirect the default log output of Caliburn and use Common.Logging instead
            Caliburn.Micro.LogManager.GetLog = type => new CommonLoggingAdapter(type);
        }

        protected Bootstrapper()
        {
            this.Initialize();
        }

        protected override void Configure()
        {
            var builder = new ContainerBuilder();

            var catalogs = new List<ComposablePartCatalog>();

            // Register basic services required by Caliburn
            builder.RegisterType<WindowManager>()
                .As<IWindowManager>()
                .InstancePerLifetimeScope();

**Edit 2: SOLVED!** Need to add the DesignTime View assembly to the SelectAssemblies method of the Boostrapper. Bootstrapper and Views are not in the same Assembly (in my case).

            }

            yield return typeof(MyDesignTimeView).Assembly; // !!!IMPORTANT!!!
            yield return Assembly.GetEntryAssembly();
            yield return typeof(TViewModel).Assembly;
        }

Essentially after powershell is running i want to do a Enter-PSSession to connect to remote computer but i don't want to prompt for username and password there.

I know this can be done.
PS C:\> $C = Get-Credential
PS C:\> Enter-PsSession -ComputerName ""Server01"" -Credential $C

I don't want to ask the user for credentials, instead i want to set it in the variable when invoking powershell. How can i achieve this ?"

Current approach is two fold,

**Dump the password via C#**

    string cmd = ""\"""" + mypwd+ ""\"""" + @"" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force | convertfrom-securestring | out-file output"";
    PowerShellInstance.AddScript(cmd);
    Collection<PSObject> PSOutput = PowerShellInstance.Invoke();


**read it in powershell**

    $pwd = Get-Content .\output | ConvertTo-SecureString
    $localcred = New-Object -typename System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist ""myusername"",$pwd
    
    Enter-PSSession -ComputerName 192.168.2.51 -Credential $localcred

Basically, a base class ( renderer ), and a derived class ( opengl_renderer ) from it. I declare an extern instance of the opengl_renderer class in the opengl_renderer header. All these files are compiled into the same library. For some reason, if I declare/instantiate the instance in the opengl_renderer class cpp file, it never gets instantiated, but if declare/instantiate it in the base renderer class cpp file, then it does.

If I build and run this code, this is the output:

    renderer_class::renderer_class()
    opengl_renderer::opengl_renderer()
    Pointer is 0x10b306090
    print from opengl class

But, if I comment this line

    opengl_renderer opengl_renderer_instance; 

in renderer.cpp, and uncomment that same line in opengl_renderer.cpp, the output is 

    Pointer is 0x0

Why does it behave like this? Is the linker removing my opengl class declaration when declared in the opengl, so it it not detecting that it is actually being used?
If so, why does it behave differently just because I declare it on the base cpp file? Its the same library, shouldn't it NOT be cutting away my instantiation?"

The easiest way to do this I believe is to convert the Regular Grid Database into a format (e.g., wavefront .obj) that can be imported into Blender for example.  The Regular Grid Data base has the following format:
first line has three integers for example
142     142     64
The first line has three integers, denoting the dimensions of the grid. In the example above, the grid is 142 x 142 x 64 boxes. Assume 1 meter voxel cubes

The reminder of the file has six columns

The remainder of the file consists of lines with six columns of data. The first three columns indicate the voxel index (counting from 0). The fourth column indicates a material ID corresponding to an entry in a separate Material Database file (.mat). The fifth column indicates temperature in Kelvin. The final column indicates concentration in parts per million (ppm).

To simplify the problem lets assume that we have a single material.  If I can get this into a .obj file format then I can write a code to update other materials. 

Does anyone know of a way to do this other than by brute force?  I can do it by brute force by generating a 3D grid then stepping through the regular grid file and checking to see if it is populated with a material property or not but this still does not solve the problem of getting it into a wavefront .obj file format.

my `ind` will be 31.

All the subsites inherit the working master page. Also I checked master page of each site one by one. All of them were referencing the working version.

I know the code is not the right one for what I'm trying to achieve, but it was the best I could do with my limited knowledge of coding.

I should mention that the search function at the moment doesn't work particularly well (i.e. it doesn't return all the results that it should, just a few tagged elements), but I'm not sure where the problem lies with that."

Everything worked it was all good but given what I wanted to do I needed to use listviews instead of textviews to display my data and be able to edit, delete etc. For some reason listviews are a different animal on android than other programming languages. I figured out adapters and all that nonsense. My new problem was that My app wouldnt display the data and when i checked my logcat I got this message 
     Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: column '_id' does not exist. Available columns: [id, termName, termStart, termEnd]


That was for one table named 'term_table'. So I changed the id from 'id' to '_id' and that did the trick.

So everything is all good right? Nope, because the other two tables have their own ID's and foreign keys. When I did the same query for a different table named 'assess_table' I got the same error so I change the 'id' to  '_id' . The problem is 'courses_table' (third table) uses '_id' as a foreign key to reference a table called 'term_table'. So i get an error telling me i was creating duplicate columns- the primary key '_id' and the foreign key '_id' to reference term_table. 

I rename the id of 'courses_table' from '_id' to 'courses_id'. Now I'm back to square one getting the same error: 

     Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: column '_id' does not exist. Available columns: [assess_id, assessName, assessDueDate, assessType, courses_id]

So basically if all three tables have to be named _id what syntax am I supposed to use when creating foreign keys if the foreign keys have the same name as the primary key of the referenced table, so I'll always get the creating duplicate columns error. I read that this _id naming scheme is only a thing with cursor adapters. What syntax is appropriate to use?

However this doesn't account for the consultations being in the current year like I want. I know that I'll probably have to incorporate ""year(date_timestamp)=year(now())"" somewhere but I don't know how, what am I missing here? Would really appreciate your response, thank you."

		and employee_VAT in (select doctor_VAT
                             from consultation 
                             where doctor_VAT in(select doctor_VAT

                                                 group by doctor_VAT having count(*)>100))
 
However this doesn't account for the consultations being in the current year like I want. I know that I'll probably have to incorporate ""year(date_timestamp)=year(now())"" somewhere but I don't know how, what am I missing here?"

59910151,1/25/2020 14:28,Initial Body,"I'm testing a CNN model based on the cifar10 keras dataset. So, basically 

    
    
    prediction = mymodel.predict(x)
    print(prediction)

prints out the prediction itself:

    [[3.3675440e-04 5.7650192e-07 2.5850117e-02 5.4446888e-01 7.0444457e-02

What's the correct syntax, given the cifar10 class labels 

    classes = ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']

to print the **predicted label** instead?"

I am passing grid-data(from php) to the Grid component.
The component looks like this:

If i click the ""add""-button, it will add a new row to the table.
When i click on the ""table""-link, the component changes to table.
When i click on the ""grid""-link, to get back to the grid component, it keeps the new addet rows.

The console.log is showing the props with the new addet rows from state.

Take a look at: streamable.com/ks8wf The Grid Component is filled with props. The table Component isn't. If i change the url to table, the grid isn't resetted. If i change from table to grid and back, the table component is resetted

To my eyes it seems as if the 2 MPU-6050s are having their data calulated diferently,(they are supposed to not have any functions applied to them right now). In the end I want it to be rotational data mapped to 0-259. I know Jeff Rowberg has a great library for this but I want to do this myself so I understand it for the future so I can modify it. My code:
```
#include <Wire.h>

long accelX, accelY, accelZ;
float gForceX, gForceY, gForceZ, gyroX, gyroY, gyroZ,rotX, rotY, rotZ;
long accelX2, accelY2, accelZ2;
float gForceX2, gForceY2, gForceZ2;

void setup(){
  //write all ADO's to high to raise thieR adress to 0x69
  pinMode(22, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(22, HIGH);
  pinMode(23, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(23, HIGH);
  pinMode(24, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(24, HIGH);
  
  Wire.begin();
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x69);
  Wire.write(0x6B);
  Wire.write(0b00000000);
  Wire.endTransmission();  
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x69);
  Wire.write(0x1B);
  Wire.write(0x00000000);
  Wire.endTransmission(); 
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x69);
  Wire.write(0x1C);
  Wire.write(0b00000000);
  Wire.endTransmission(); 
  
  Wire.begin();
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x68);
  Wire.write(0x6B);
  Wire.write(0b00000000);
  Wire.endTransmission();  
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x68);
  Wire.write(0x1B);
  Wire.write(0x00000000);
  Wire.endTransmission(); 
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x68);
  Wire.write(0x1C);
  Wire.write(0b00000000);
  Wire.endTransmission(); 
  
  Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop(){
  GetMpuValue(22);
  Serial.print(""\t ||| \t"");
  GetMpuValue(23);
  Serial.println(""\t"");
}

void GetMpuValue(int pin){
  digitalWrite(pin, LOW);
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x68); 
  Wire.write(0x3B);
  Wire.endTransmission();
  Wire.requestFrom(0x68,6);
  
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x68);
  Wire.write(0x43);
  Wire.endTransmission();
  Wire.requestFrom(0x68,6);
  while(Wire.available() < 6);
  gyroX = Wire.read()<<8|Wire.read();
  gyroY = Wire.read()<<8|Wire.read();
  gyroZ = Wire.read()<<8|Wire.read(); 
  digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);

  Serial.print(""gyro\t"");
  Serial.print(gyroX);
  Serial.print(""\t"");
  Serial.print(gyroY);
  Serial.print(""\t"");
  Serial.print(gyroZ);
}
```
Ty you guys in advance!"
61754933,5/12/2020 14:54,Initial Title,Is there a way to convert raw MPU-6050 data to a 0-259 rotational data

61754933,5/13/2020 16:19,Edit Body,"Im building a Oculus Quest this week. Its meant to be a fun (cheap) project to work on And I figured out how to calculate limb displacement if a constant(foot placement) position is tracked positonaly. I have already to manage to add more than 2 MPU-6050s on the same arduino at once. The problem comes when I want to take the serial data from the MPU and put it into unity. The rotational data is very wrong it looks like this:

To my eyes it seems as if the 2 MPU-6050s are having their data calulated diferently,(they are supposed to not have any functions applied to them right now). In the end I want it to be rotational data mapped to 0-359. I know Jeff Rowberg has a great library for this but I want to do this myself so I understand it for the future so I can modify it. My code:
```
#include <Wire.h>

long accelX, accelY, accelZ;
float gForceX, gForceY, gForceZ, gyroX, gyroY, gyroZ,rotX, rotY, rotZ;
long accelX2, accelY2, accelZ2;
float gForceX2, gForceY2, gForceZ2;

void setup(){
  //write all ADO's to high to raise thieR adress to 0x69
  pinMode(22, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(22, HIGH);
  pinMode(23, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(23, HIGH);
  pinMode(24, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(24, HIGH);
  
  Wire.begin();
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x69);
  Wire.write(0x6B);
  Wire.write(0b00000000);
  Wire.endTransmission();  
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x69);
  Wire.write(0x1B);
  Wire.write(0x00000000);
  Wire.endTransmission(); 
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x69);

  Wire.write(0b00000000);
  Wire.endTransmission();  
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x68);
  Wire.write(0x1B);
  Wire.write(0x00000000);
  Wire.endTransmission(); 
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x68);
  Wire.write(0x1C);
  Wire.write(0b00000000);
  Wire.endTransmission(); 
  
  Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop(){
  GetMpuValue(22);
  Serial.print(""\t ||| \t"");
  GetMpuValue(23);
  Serial.println(""\t"");
}

void GetMpuValue(int pin){
  digitalWrite(pin, LOW);
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x68); 
  Wire.write(0x3B);
  Wire.endTransmission();
  Wire.requestFrom(0x68,6);
  
  Wire.beginTransmission(0x68);
  Wire.write(0x43);
  Wire.endTransmission();
  Wire.requestFrom(0x68,6);
  while(Wire.available() < 6);
  gyroX = Wire.read()<<8|Wire.read();
  gyroY = Wire.read()<<8|Wire.read();
  gyroZ = Wire.read()<<8|Wire.read(); 
  digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);

  Serial.print(""gyro\t"");
  Serial.print(gyroX);
  Serial.print(""\t"");
  Serial.print(gyroY);
  Serial.print(""\t"");
  Serial.print(gyroZ);
}
```

When a user clicks on this button, I want to display this specific profile/record on a new page by itself. If I was fetching data on my own, i.e. without Algolia's code I would be able to do this, but in this case I'm not really sure how to do this.

If I click on the network tab in the console, and on the algolia query search URI, I can see that the search results are in results[0].hits. Below is a screenshot of this data.

P.S. My data is empty it just contains algolia client ID's.

How can I display a single id on a new page? I understand that I need to get the id from the record that is being displayed, and show this information on a new page, but I don't know how to put it all together.

Again I think I'll need a route, so I created this
```Route::get('/employer/search/filter-by/show/{id}', 'EmployerSearchController@show')->name('employer.search.show');```

I'm using Laravel for my backend. Thanks in advance.

------------------------------------- UPDATED: -------------------------------------

I feel like I'm really close, but $itemId in my controller after I die and dump returns ""undefined"" for some reason.

router.js (Vue Router):
```
{
                path: '/employer/search/filter-by/:itemId/show',
                name: 'employer-search-index',
                component: SearchIndex,
                meta: {
                    breadcrumb: 'Search Candidates',
                    requiresAuthEmployer: true,
                    employerHasPaid: true
                },
            },
```

EmployerSearchComponent.vue - with the ```<router-link>``` button:
```
<template slot=""item"" slot-scope=""{ item }"">
    <b-col cols=""12"" class=""mb-3"">
        <b-card>
            <div class=""float-right"">
                <router-link class=""apply-job-btn btn btn-radius theme-btn apply-it"" :to=""'/employer/search/filter-by/' + item.id + '/show'"">View Profile</router-link>
            </div>

            <h4 style=""margin-bottom: 20px;""><router-link to=""/"">{{item.job_title}}</router-link></h4>
            <p>Type: {{item.employment_type}}</p>
            <b-card-text class=""mt-2""><span v-if=""item.experience && item.experience.length < 300"">{{item.experience}}</span><span v-else>{{item.experience && item.experience.substring(0,300)+""...""}}</span></b-card-text>
        </b-card>
    </b-col>
</template>
```

EmployerSearchController.php:
```
public function show ($itemId)
    {
        $candidateProfiles = CandidateProfile::with(['user', 'photo', 'resume', 'video'])
        ->where('id', '=', $itemId)->get();

        return Response::json(array(
            'candidateProfiles' => $candidateProfiles,
        ), 200);

    }
```

api.php:
```
Route::get('/employer/search/filter-by/{itemId}/show', 'EmployerSearchController@show')->name('employer.search.show');
```

And Finally, in the .vue file that shows the Full Single Profile, I'm loading the data like this.
```
methods: {
    loadCandidateProfileData: async function () {
        try {
            const response = await employerService.loadCandidateProfileData();
            this.candidateProfiles = response.data.candidateProfiles;

        } catch (error) {
            this.$toast.error(""Some error occurred, please refresh!"");
        }
    },
}
```

And the employerService.js file from the above code:
```
export function loadCandidateProfileData(itemId, data) {
    return http().get(`employer/search/filter-by/${itemId}/show`, data);
}

If I click on the network tab in the console, and on the algolia query search URI, I can see that the search results are in results[0].hits. Below is a screenshot of this data.

P.S. My data is empty it just contains algolia client ID's.

How can I display a single id on a new page? I understand that I need to get the id from the record that is being displayed, and show this information on a new page, but I don't know how to put it all together.

Again I think I'll need a route, so I created this
```Route::get('/employer/search/filter-by/show/{id}', 'EmployerSearchController@show')->name('employer.search.show');```

I'm using Laravel for my backend. Thanks in advance.

------------------------------------- UPDATED: -------------------------------------

I feel like I'm really close, but $itemId in my controller after I die and dump returns ""undefined"" for some reason.

router.js (Vue Router):
```
{
                path: '/employer/search/filter-by/:itemId/show',
                name: 'employer-search-index',
                component: SearchIndex,
                meta: {
                    breadcrumb: 'Search Candidates',
                    requiresAuthEmployer: true,
                    employerHasPaid: true
                },
            },
```

EmployerSearchComponent.vue - with the ```<router-link>``` button:
```
<template slot=""item"" slot-scope=""{ item }"">
    <b-col cols=""12"" class=""mb-3"">
        <b-card>
            <div class=""float-right"">
                <router-link class=""apply-job-btn btn btn-radius theme-btn apply-it"" :to=""'/employer/search/filter-by/' + item.id + '/show'"">View Profile</router-link>
            </div>

            <h4 style=""margin-bottom: 20px;""><router-link to=""/"">{{item.job_title}}</router-link></h4>
            <p>Type: {{item.employment_type}}</p>
            <b-card-text class=""mt-2""><span v-if=""item.experience && item.experience.length < 300"">{{item.experience}}</span><span v-else>{{item.experience && item.experience.substring(0,300)+""...""}}</span></b-card-text>
        </b-card>
    </b-col>
</template>
```

EmployerSearchController.php:
```
public function show ($itemId)
    {
        $candidateProfiles = CandidateProfile::with(['user', 'photo', 'resume', 'video'])
        ->where('id', '=', $itemId)->get();

        return Response::json(array(
            'candidateProfiles' => $candidateProfiles,
        ), 200);

    }
```

api.php:
```
Route::get('/employer/search/filter-by/{itemId}/show', 'EmployerSearchController@show')->name('employer.search.show');
```

And Finally, in the .vue file that shows the Full Single Profile, I'm loading the data like this.
```
mounted() {
            this.loadCandidateProfileData();
        },

methods: {
    loadCandidateProfileData: async function () {
        try {
            const response = await employerService.loadCandidateProfileData();
            this.candidateProfiles = response.data.candidateProfiles;

        } catch (error) {
            this.$toast.error(""Some error occurred, please refresh!"");
        }
    },
}
```

And the employerService.js file from the above code:
```
export function loadCandidateProfileData(itemId, data) {
    return http().get(`employer/search/filter-by/${itemId}/show`, data);
}
```"

I tried to reverse engineer the above example along with the [Office add-in documentation on creating a Javascript shared runtime][2]. At this point I do have an excel add-in built upon Angular working but can't get the shared Javascript runtime aspect working.

In my project, I've added 2 buttons in the ribbon: ""Open task pane"" and ""Close task pane"". The intended behavior is to use these buttons to open and close the taskpane (...sounds simple enough). At the moment, neither of these buttons seem to work even though the functions I've attached to them in the <FunctionName> tags should be defined and available through the global command object.

I've played around with the <Runtimes> tag in the ""manifest.xml"" file but uncommenting out the tag seems to just break everything.

Here's my [repo][3]. I'm not sure if it'll help or if it'd be easier to solve this by starting from scratch, but if someone could tell me what I'm doing incorrectly or point me towards a repo/code sample for an Office add-in for Excel the uses Angular and shares a Javascript runtime, that would be lovely.

65798572,1/19/2021 19:54,Initial Title,Unexplained behavior of '<int> in [] == <boolean>' construct
65798572,1/19/2021 19:54,Initial Body,"Consider

    1 in [] == False

On a very quick glance, it appears that this will raise a `TypeError: bool is not iterable`, but it actually executes (and evaluates to `False` if you are curious).

However,

    1 in [1] == False

is also evaluating to `False`.

It is interesting to note that `1 in [] == False` does **not**:

- Evaluate as `1 in ([] == False)` - This causes the expected `TypeError` mentioned above.
- Evaluate as `(1 in []) == False` - This can be confirmed by `(1 in []) == False` which outputs `True`, compared to `1 in [] == False` which evaluates to `False`.

The only output that does make sense is `(1 in [1]) == False` which is `False`.

`dis.dis` outputs:

    dis.dis('1 in [] == False')
    print()
    print()
    print()
    dis.dis('(1 in [1]) == False')
    print()
    print()
    print()
    dis.dis('1 in ([] == False)')

outputs

    1 in [] == False

On a very quick glance, it appears that this will raise a `TypeError: bool is not iterable`, but it actually executes (and evaluates to `False` if you are curious, which is also a bit surprising).

However,

    1 in [1] == False

is also evaluating to `False`.

It is interesting to note that `1 in [] == False` does **not**:

- Evaluate as `1 in ([] == False)` - This causes the expected `TypeError` mentioned above.
- Evaluate as `(1 in []) == False` - This can be confirmed by `(1 in []) == False` which outputs `True`, compared to `1 in [] == False` which evaluates to `False`.

The only output that does make sense is `(1 in [1]) == False` which is `False`.

`dis.dis` outputs:

    dis.dis('1 in [] == False')
    print()
    print()
    print()
    dis.dis('(1 in [1]) == False')

69695606,10/24/2021 9:55,Initial Body,"In WordPress, how can I remove the action below, which is inside a class in a plugin?

The plugin includes this (I'm just quoting a few lines of it):
```
class WC_Product_Vendors_Vendor_Admin {
	public static function init() {
		self::$self = new self();
		add_action( 'pre_get_users', array( self::$self, 'filter_users' ) );
	}
}
WC_Product_Vendors_Vendor_Admin::init();
```

In my own custom plugin, I tried:

```
function remove_my_class_action() {
    remove_action ( 'pre_get_users', array( WC_Product_Vendors_Vendor_Admin::$instance , 'filter_users') );
}
add_action( 'plugins_loaded', 'remove_my_class_action' );
```

But Wordpress doesn't even let me save it — it says the class is not found.

I also tried `getInstance()` instead of `$instance`.

Instead of `'plugins_loaded'` I also tried `'wp_head'` and `'init'`.

Also tried different priorities on both add_action and remove_action, it doesn't make a difference. (Though it could be there's some combination of the above that I missed.)"

72505270,6/5/2022 6:34,Initial Tags,<python><tkinter><pygame>
72505270,6/5/2022 6:34,Initial Body,"So today, while I was trying to create a music player using Tkinter with pygame, I noticed something weird. When I tried changing the volume of my player, it was not setting it up accurately. So what the problem is, when I tried to set the volume to `0.9`, it ended up putting it to `0.8984375`. I have no idea how these two numbers are related. And when I tried to set it to `0.8`, it set the volume to `0.796875`. But it worked when I put it to `0.5`, which means it only works for 0.5 accurately. I have tried every possible way to overcome this, but nothing helped.

So anyone got any idea what is wrong with my pygame? The part of the code which I use to set up the volume is given below:

*Note: I have already initiated pygame mixer. Here, the parameter self refers to my player's main class and event is used for my keybinds.*

```python
def decVol(self,event):
            d = mixer.music.get_volume()
            print(d) # d is 1.0 now!
            mixer.music.set_volume(0.9)
            print(mixer.music.get_volume()) # Prints as 0.8984375 <--- -_-
```
I am not providing the rest of the codes since it is useless to reproduce this situation and is working fine (Just some labels and stuff). This is the only part that handles volume. And as far as I know, I think it's something on my computer's end. Well, I'm on windows 10 x64, btw. If you know something about this, please suggest some better ways to do this."

I am not getting any error, I am just not seeing the table of data.  And strangely, the HTML tags are getting capitalized.

How can I get the correct data into the currentsiteData variable to further process?

I have tried several combinations but in combinations with more recent dask versions, where I get `dask.dataframe` working (e.g. `dask 2023.2.0` and `pandas 2.1.2` in `Python 3.10.12`), I run into problems with the import of the Client:

`from distributed import Client`

```

    from distributed import Client

78907548,8/23/2024 21:02,Initial Title,Trying to optimize my ARPLS implementation

It currently takes ~0.15 seconds to process a spectrum of ~4000 wavelengths, but applied to millions of spectra, it would take a while, to say the least. Am I missing an obvious vectorized solution, or is the algorithm simply that heavy?

	""""""
	Fits a baseline signal to the given spectrum using Asymmetrically Reweighted Penalized Least Squares smoothing.

	### Parameters
	- spectrum: `NDArray[np.floating]` -- The 1D spectrum input array.
	- smoothing_factor: `float`, optional -- Smoothing strength parameter.\
		The larger the parameter, the smoother the resulting baseline.\
		High values suppress small fluctuations, which may lead to a smoother but less sensitive baseline.
	- convergence_tolerance: `float`, optional -- Convergence criterion based on the change in weights between iterations.\
		Must be a value between 0 and 1. Smaller values allow less negative deviations, promoting a more accurate baseline fitting.
	- differentiation_order: `int`, optional -- The order of the difference operator used in penalization.\
		An order of 1 enforces a linear baseline (smoothing the first derivative), while an order of 2 enforces a quadratic baseline (smoothing the second derivative).\
		Higher orders allow for more complex baseline shapes.
	- max_iterations: `int`, optional -- Maximum number of iterations to perform.\
		The algorithm iteratively refines the baseline until the convergence criterion is met or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
	- edge_padding: `int`, optional -- Number of points to pad on both ends of the spectrum to improve baseline fitting at the edges.\
		Padding is done using edge values to minimize boundary effects.

	### Returns
	- `NDArray[np.floating]` -- The fitted baseline signal array of the same length as the input spectrum (after removing padding).

	### Raises
	- `ValueError` -- If the ratio is not between 0 and 1.

	### Reference
	- https://irfpy.irf.se/projects/ica/api/api_irfpy.ica.baseline.html#irfpy.ica.baseline.arpls

	### Notes
	The ARPLS algorithm is particularly useful for baseline correction in spectra where the baseline is not well-defined and varies in a complex way.
	The algorithm iteratively adjusts the baseline by penalizing large deviations while allowing for asymmetric weighting, making it robust for various types of spectral data.

79451235,2/19/2025 11:57,Initial Title,Multiple cursors follow mouse in Javascript
79451235,2/19/2025 11:57,Initial Body,"I have a grid with multiple items. Each item has its own custom cursor with the div `.grid__item-cursor`. 

What I'm trying to achieve is when hovering an item, its cursor follows the mouse with a smooth speed.

The issue is when hovering an item, all the cursors from the document move at the same time. And there is also too much distance between the custom cursor and the mouse.

Here is a [codepen][1] where you can see it live.
