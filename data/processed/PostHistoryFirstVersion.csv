90178,Make a div fill the remaining screen space,"I am currently working on a web application, where I want the content to fill the entire screen. I have a header `div` and a content `div`. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:

CSS:

    #page {
      height: 100%;
    }
    #tdcontent {
      height: 100%;
    }

HTML:

    <table id=""page"">
      <tr><td id=""tdheader"">
        <div id=""header"">...</div>
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td id=""tdcontent>
        <div id=""content"">...</div>
      </td>
    </table>

Which works how I like. The table remains at 100%, and the `tdcontent` element is always less than 100%. Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the `table`?",<table><css><html>

2709821,python 'self' explained,"What is the purpose of the 'self' word in python. I understand it refers to the specific object created from that class, but i cant see why it explicitly needs to be added to very function as a parameter. To illustrate, in ruby, i could do this:

    class myClass
        def myFunc(name)
            @name = name
        end
    end

Which i understand, quite easily, However in python i need to include self:

    class myClass:
        def myFunc(self, name):
            self.name = name

Can anyone talk me through this? its not something ive come across in my (admittedly limited) experience.
Any help would be appreciated.",<python><self><explain>
3106452,java servlet instantiation and session variables,"Out of curiosity and naivety:

Suppose, I have a webserver which holds numerous servlets. For information passing among those servlets I am getting the servlet context and setting session variables. Now, if 2 or more users send request to this server then what happens to the session variables? Will they all be common for all the users or they will be different for each user. If they are different, then how was the server able to differentiate between different users?

One more similar questions,
If there are n users accessing a particular servlet, then this servlet gets instantiated only the first time the first user accessed it or it gets instantiated for all the users separately?

5844672,Delete an element from a dictionary,"Is there a way to delete an element from a dictionary in python?

I know i can just call `.pop` on the dictionary, but that returns the element that was removed. What im looking for is something returns the dictionary *minus* the element in question. 

At present i have a helper function that accepts the dictionary in question as parameter, and then returns a dictionary with the element removed, i just wondered whether there was more elegant solution?",<python><dictionary><remove>

10123953,Sort Javascript Object Array By Date,"Say I have an array of a few objects:

    var array = [{id: 1 date: Mar 12 2012 10:00:00 AM}{id: 2 date: Mar 8 2012 08:00:00 AM}];

How can I sort this array by the date element in order from the date closest to the current date and time down? Keep in mind that the array may have many objects, but for the sake of simplicity I used 2.

Would I use the sort function and a custom comparator?",<javascript><datetime>
