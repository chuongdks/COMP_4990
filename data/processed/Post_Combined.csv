90178,2008-09-18 05:06:17,Initial Body,,"I am currently working on a web application, where I want the content to fill the entire screen. I have a header `div` and a content `div`. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:

CSS:

    #page {
      height: 100%;
    }
    #tdcontent {
      height: 100%;
    }

HTML:

    <table id=""page"">

      <tr><td id=""tdcontent>
        <div id=""content"">...</div>

Which works how I like. The table remains at 100%, and the `tdcontent` element is always less than 100%. Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the `table`?"

<p>In all sane browsers, you can put the ""header"" div before the content, as a sibling, and the same CSS will work.  However, IE7- does not interpret the height correctly if the float is 100% in that case, so the header needs to be IN the content, as above.  The overflow: auto will cause double scroll bars on IE (which always has the viewport scrollbar visible, but disabled), but without it, the content will clip if it overflows.</p>

90178,2008-09-18 08:16:50,Answers,294,"<p>There really isn't a sound, cross-browser way to do this in CSS.  Assuming your layout has complexities, you need to use JavaScript to set the element's height.  The essence of what you need to do is:</p>

<pre><code>Element Height = Viewport height - element.offset.top - desired bottom margin
</code></pre>

<p>Once you can get this value and set the element's height, you need to attach event handlers to both the window onload and onresize so that you can fire your resize function.</p>

<p>Also, assuming your content could be larger than the viewport, you will need to set overflow-y to scroll.</p>
"
90178,2008-09-18 17:52:16,Answers,7,"<p>Vincent, I'll answer again using your new requirements.  Since you don't care about the content being hidden if it's too long,  you don't need to float the header.  Just put overflow hidden on the html and body tags, and set <code>#content</code> height to 100%. The content will always be longer than the viewport by the height of the header, but it'll be hidden and won't cause scrollbars.</p>

90178,2011-04-11 15:48:06,Answers,29,"<p>I've been searching for an answer for this as well. If you are fortunate enough to be able to target IE8 and up, you can use <code>display:table</code> and related values to get the rendering rules of tables with block-level elements including div.</p>

90178,2011-06-20 09:36:23,Answers,13,"<p>I wresteled with this for a while and ended up with the following:</p>

<p>Since it is easy to make the content DIV the same height as the parent but apparently difficult to make it the parent height minus the header height I decided to make content div full height but position it absolutely in the top left corner and then define a padding for the top which has the height of the header. This way the content displays neatly under the header and fills the whole remaining space:</p>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>body {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    height: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
}

#header {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    height: 50px;
}

#content {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    padding-top: 50px;
    height: 100%;
}

  background-color: green;
}

<p>JS</p>

<pre><code>function resize() {
  // Get elements and necessary element heights
  var contentDiv = document.getElementById(""contentId"");
  var headerDiv = document.getElementById(""headerId"");
  var headerHeight = headerDiv.offsetHeight;

  // Get view height
  var viewportHeight = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].clientHeight;

  // Compute the content height - we want to fill the whole remaining area
  // in browser window
  contentDiv.style.height = viewportHeight - headerHeight;
}

window.onload = resize;
window.onresize = resize;

The only one missing is support for <code>subgrid</code> which in only supported by Firefox.

<p><strong>Some advantages of this method are:</strong></p>

<p>1) Less markup</p>

<p>2) Markup is more semantic than tables, because this is not tabular data.</p>

90178,2013-07-05 21:17:02,Answers,9,"<p>You can actually use <code>display: table</code> to split the area into two elements (header and content), where the header can vary in height and the content fills the remaining space. This works with the whole page, as well as when the area is simply the content of another element positioned with <code>position</code> set to <code>relative</code>, <code>absolute</code> or <code>fixed</code>. It will work as long as the parent element has a non-zero height.</p>

90178,2013-08-01 14:47:04,Edit Body,,"I am currently working on a web application, where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen.

The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom.

I have a header `div` and a content `div`. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:

CSS:

<!-- language: lang-css -->

    #page {
      height: 100%; width: 100%
    }
    #tdcontent {
      height: 100%;
    }
    #content {
      overflow: auto; /* or overflow: hidden; */
    }

HTML:

<!-- language: lang-html -->

    <table id=""page"">
      <tr><td id=""tdheader"">
        <div id=""header"">...</div>
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td id=""tdcontent"">
        <div id=""content"">...</div>
      </td>
    </table>


The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.

For anything inside the content div, setting `top: 0;` will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with it's height set to 100%. Putting `header` inside `content` will not allow this to work.

Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the `table`?

**Update:**

Elements inside the content `div` will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the `div` will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.

**Update 2:**

For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside `#content` would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works."

<p>When you want the middle element to span across entire page vertically, you can use <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>calc()</code></a> which is introduced in CSS3.</p>

<p>Assuming we have a <em>fixed height</em> <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code> elements and we want the <code>section</code> tag to take entire available vertical height...</p>

90178,2014-07-27 08:14:37,Answers,1768,"<h3>2015 update: the flexbox approach</h3>

<p>There are two other answers briefly mentioning <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes"" rel=""noreferrer"">flexbox</a>; however, that was more than two years ago, and they don't provide any examples. The specification for flexbox has definitely settled now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Though CSS Flexible Boxes Layout specification is at the Candidate Recommendation stage, not all browsers have implemented it. WebKit implementation must be prefixed with -webkit-; Internet Explorer implements an old version of the spec, prefixed with -ms-; Opera 12.10 implements the latest version of the spec, unprefixed. See the compatibility table on each property for an up-to-date compatibility status.</p>
  
  <p>(taken from <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All major browsers and IE11+ support Flexbox. For IE 10 or older, you can use the FlexieJS shim.</p>

<p>To check current support you can also see here:
<a href=""http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox</a></p>

<h3>Working example</h3>

<p>With flexbox you can easily switch between any of your rows or columns either having fixed dimensions, content-sized dimensions or remaining-space dimensions. In my example I have set the header to snap to its content (as per the OPs question), I've added a footer to show how to add a fixed-height region and then set the content area to fill up the remaining space.</p>

  */
}

.box .row.content {
  flex: 1 1 auto;
}

.box .row.footer {
  flex: 0 1 40px;
}</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;!-- Obviously, you could use HTML5 tags like `header`, `footer` and `section` --&gt;

&lt;div class=""box""&gt;

      &lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;div class=""row footer""&gt;

<p><strong>HTML 5</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;Header with an arbitrary height&lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
        This container will grow so as to take the remaining height

<p><strong>CSS</strong></p>

<pre><code>body {

  min-height: 100vh;       /* body takes whole viewport's height */
}

main {
  flex: 1;                 /* this will make the container take the free space */

90178,2016-07-01 20:53:17,Answers,5,"<p>Spinning off the idea of Mr. Alien...</p>

<p>This seems a cleaner solution than the popular flex box one for CSS3 enabled browsers.</p>

<p>Simply use min-height(instead of height) with calc() to the content block. </p>

<p>The calc() starts with 100% and subtracts heights of headers and footers (need to include padding values)</p>

<p>Using ""min-height"" instead of ""height"" is particularly useful so it can work with javascript rendered content and JS frameworks like Angular2. Otherwise, the calculation will not push the footer to the bottom of the page once the javascript rendered content is visible.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of a header and footer using 50px height and 20px padding for both.</p>

<p>Html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;&lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;div class=""content""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Css:</p>

<pre><code>.content {
    min-height: calc(100% - (50px + 20px + 20px + 50px + 20px + 20px));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the math can be simplified but you get the idea...</p>
"
90178,2016-08-25 16:13:25,Answers,5,"<p>I had the same problem but I could not make work the solution with flexboxes above. So I created my own template, that includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>a header with a fixed size element</li>
<li>a footer</li>
<li>a side bar with a scrollbar that occupies the remaining height</li>
<li>content</li>
</ul>

<p>I used flexboxes but in a more simple way, using only properties <strong>display: flex</strong> and <strong>flex-direction: row|column</strong>:</p>

<p>I do use angular and I want my component sizes to be 100% of their parent element.</p>

<p>The key is to set the size (in percents) for all parents inorder to limit their size. In the following example myapp height has 100% of the viewport.</p>

<p>The main component has 90% of the viewport, because header and footer have 5%.</p>

The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom.

I have a header `div` and a content `div`. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:

CSS and HTML

<!-- begin snippet: js hide: false -->

<!-- language: lang-css -->

    #page {
        height: 100%; width: 100%
    }

    #tdcontent {
        height: 100%;
    }

    #content {
        overflow: auto; /* or overflow: hidden; */
    }

<!-- language: lang-html -->


    <table id=""page"">
        <tr>
            <td id=""tdheader"">
                <div id=""header"">...</div>

        </tr>
    </table>


<!-- end snippet -->


The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.

For anything inside the content div, setting `top: 0;` will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with it's height set to 100%. Putting `header` inside `content` will not allow this to work.

Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the `table`?

**Update:**

Elements inside the content `div` will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the `div` will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.

**Update 2:**

For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside `#content` would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works."

90178,2023-06-27 02:02:00,Edit Body,,"I am working on a web application where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen.

The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom.

I have a header `div` and a content `div`. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:

CSS and HTML

<!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: false babel: false -->

<!-- language: lang-css -->

    #page {
      height: 100%;
      width: 100%
    }

    #tdcontent {
      height: 100%;
    }

    #content {
      overflow: auto;  /* or overflow: hidden; */
    }

<!-- language: lang-html -->

    <table id=""page"">
      <tr>
        <td id=""tdheader"">
          <div id=""header"">...</div>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td id=""tdcontent"">
          <div id=""content"">...</div>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<!-- end snippet -->


The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.

For anything inside the content div, setting `top: 0;` will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with its height set to 100%. Putting `header` inside `content` will not allow this to work.

Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the `table`?

**Update:**

Elements inside the content `div` will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the `div` will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.

**Update 2:**

For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside `#content` would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works."

<p>On Safari you may notice that the height being incorrect when you have height of 100vh because the toolbar messes with the browser height.

<p>The <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>===</code>, and <code>!==</code> operators require you to use <code>date.getTime()</code> as in</p>
<pre><code>var d1 = new Date();

var same = d1.getTime() === d2.getTime();

492994,2009-01-29 19:35:19,Answers,7,"<p>In order to create dates from free text in JavaScript you need to parse it into the <code>Date</code> object.</p>
<p>You could use <code>Date.parse()</code> which takes free text and tries to convert it into a new date but if you have control over the page I would recommend using HTML select boxes instead or a date picker such as the <a href=""https://clarle.github.io/yui3/yui/docs/calendar/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YUI calendar control</a> or the <a href=""https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jQuery UI Datepicker</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have a date, as other people have pointed out, you can use simple arithmetic to subtract the dates and convert it back into a number of days by dividing the number (in seconds) by the number of seconds in a day (60*60*24 = 86400).</p>
"
492994,2009-01-31 00:18:07,Answers,487,"<p>The easiest way to compare dates in javascript is to first convert it to a Date object and then compare these date-objects.</p>

<li><p><strong>dates.compare(a,b)</strong></p>

<p>Returns a number:</p>

<ul>
<li>-1 if a &lt; b</li>
<li>0 if a = b</li>
<li>1 if a &gt; b</li>
<li>NaN if a or b is an illegal date</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>dates.inRange</strong> (d,start,end)</p>

<p>Returns a boolean or NaN:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>true</em> if <em>d</em> is between the <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> (inclusive)</li>
<li><em>false</em> if <em>d</em> is before <em>start</em> or after <em>end</em>.</li>
<li>NaN if one or more of the dates are illegal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>dates.convert</strong></p>

<p>Used by the other functions to convert their input to a date object. The input can be</p>

<ul>
<li>a <strong>date</strong>-object : The input is returned as is.</li>
<li>an <strong>array</strong>: Interpreted as [year,month,day]. <strong>NOTE</strong> month is 0-11.</li>
<li>a <strong>number</strong> : Interpreted as number of milliseconds since 1 Jan 1970 (a timestamp) </li>
<li>a <strong>string</strong> : Several different formats is supported, like ""YYYY/MM/DD"", ""MM/DD/YYYY"", ""Jan 31 2009"" etc.</li>
<li>an <strong>object</strong>: Interpreted as an object with year, month and date attributes.  <strong>NOTE</strong> month is 0-11.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Here is a function that return {boolean} if the from dateTime > to dateTime <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/NTghK/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Demo in action</a></p>

var to = '08/12/2013 00:00 '

function isFromBiggerThanTo(dtmfrom, dtmto){
   return new Date(dtmfrom).getTime() &gt;=  new Date(dtmto).getTime() ;
}
console.log(isFromBiggerThanTo(from, to)); //true
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/minagabriel/Fu7Ag/1/"" rel=""noreferrer"">jsFiddle </a></p>

<pre><code>var date_one = '2013-07-29 01:50:00',
date_two = '2013-07-29 02:50:00';
//getTime() returns the number of milliseconds since 01.01.1970.
var timeStamp_date_one = new Date(date_one).getTime() ; //1375077000000 
console.log(typeof timeStamp_date_one);//number 
var timeStamp_date_two = new Date(date_two).getTime() ;//1375080600000

<p>since you are now having both datetime in number type
you can compare them with any Comparison operations </p>

<p>( >, &lt; ,= ,!= ,== ,!== ,>= AND &lt;=) </p>

<p><strong>Then</strong></p>

<p>if you are familiar with <code>C#</code> Custom Date and Time Format String this library should do the exact same thing and help you format your date and time <a href=""https://rawgithub.com/minagabriel/dtmFRM/master/dtmFRM.js"" rel=""noreferrer"">dtmFRM</a> whether you are passing in date time string or unix format </p>

<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>

<pre><code>var myDateTime = new dtmFRM();

alert(myDateTime.ToString(1375077000000, ""MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss ampm""));

date2 = new Date(date2);

<p>parseDate() is the make common method for parsing the date.
 now you can checks your date =, > ,&lt; any type of compare</p>

                        Var Date2=parseDate($(""#getdate2"").val());
               //use any oe &lt; or &gt; or = as per ur requirment 
               if(Date1 = Date2){
         return false;  //or your code {}

492994,2017-10-20 09:51:47,Answers,13,"<p><strong>BEWARE THE TIMEZONE</strong></p>

<p>A javascript date has <em>no notion of timezone</em>. It's a moment in time (ticks since the epoch) with handy functions for translating to and from strings in the ""local"" timezone. If you want to work with dates using date objects, as everyone here is doing, <strong>you want your dates to represent UTC midnight at the start of the date in question.</strong> This is a common and necessary convention that lets you work with dates regardless of the season or timezone of their creation. So you need to be very vigilant to manage the notion of timezone, particularly when you create your midnight UTC Date object.  </p>

<p>Most of the time, you will want your date to reflect the timezone of the user. <strong>Click if today is your birthday</strong>. Users in NZ and US click at the same time and get different dates. In that case, do this...</p>

<pre><code>// create a date (utc midnight) reflecting the value of myDate and the environment's timezone offset.
new Date(Date.UTC(myDate.getFullYear(),myDate.getMonth(), myDate.getDate()));
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes, international comparability trumps local accuracy. In that case, do this...</p>

<pre><code>// the date in London of a moment in time. Device timezone is ignored.
new Date(Date.UTC(myDate.getUTCYear(), myDate.getyUTCMonth(), myDate.getUTCDate()));
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Now you can directly compare your date objects as the other answers suggest.</strong></p>

<p>Having taken care to manage timezone when you create, you also need to be sure to keep timezone out when you convert back to a string representation. <strong>So you can safely use...</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>toISOString()</code></li>
<li><code>getUTCxxx()</code></li>
<li><code>getTime() //returns a number with no time or timezone.</code></li>
<li><code>.toLocaleDateString(""fr"",{timezone:""UTC""}) // whatever locale you want, but ALWAYS UTC.</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>And totally avoid everything else, especially...</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>getYear()</code>,<code>getMonth()</code>,<code>getDate()</code> </li>
</ul>

492994,2019-06-28 06:47:49,Answers,24,"<p>The simple way is,</p>

492994,2020-01-31 17:27:06,Answers,1,"<p>All the above-given answers only solved one thing: compare two dates.</p>

<p>Indeed, they seem to be the answers to the question, but a big part is missing: </p>

<p><strong>What if I want to check whether a person is fully 18 years old?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately, NONE of the above-given answers would be able to answer that question.</strong> </p>

<p>For example, the current time (around the time when I started to type these words) is Fri Jan 31 2020 10:41:04 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time), while a customer enters his Date of Birth as ""01/31/2002"". </p>

<p>If we use <strong>""365 days/year""</strong>, which is <strong>""31536000000""</strong> milliseconds, we would get the following result:</p>

<pre><code>       let currentTime = new Date();
       let customerTime = new Date(2002, 1, 31);
       let age = (currentTime.getTime() - customerTime.getTime()) / 31536000000
       console.log(""age: "", age);
</code></pre>

<p>with the following print-out: </p>

<pre><code>       age: 17.92724710838407
</code></pre>

<p>But <strong>LEGALLY</strong>, that customer is already 18 years old. Even he enters ""01/30/2002"", the result would still be </p>

<pre><code>       age: 17.930039743467784
</code></pre>

<p>which is less than 18. The system would report the ""under age"" error.</p>

<p>And this would just keep going for ""01/29/2002"", ""01/28/2002"", ""01/27/2002"" ... ""01/05/2002"", <strong>UNTIL</strong> ""01/04/2002"". </p>

<p><strong>A system like that would just kill all the customers who were born between 18 years 0 days and 18 years 26 days ago, because they are legally 18 years old, while the system shows ""under age"".</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>The following is an answer to a question like that:</strong></p>

<pre><code>invalidBirthDate: 'Invalid date. YEAR cannot be before 1900.',
invalidAge: 'Invalid age. AGE cannot be less than 18.',

public static birthDateValidator(control: any): any {
    const val = control.value;

        const slashSplit = val.split('-');
        if (slashSplit.length === 3) {
            const customerYear = parseInt(slashSplit[0], 10);
            const customerMonth = parseInt(slashSplit[1], 10);
            const customerDate = parseInt(slashSplit[2], 10);
            if (customerYear &lt; 1900) {
                return { invalidBirthDate: true };
            } else {
                const currentTime = new Date();
                const currentYear = currentTime.getFullYear();
                const currentMonth = currentTime.getMonth() + 1;
                const currentDate = currentTime.getDate();
                if (currentYear - customerYear &lt; 18) {
                    return { invalidAge: true };
                } else if (
                    currentYear - customerYear === 18 &amp;&amp;

500504,2009-02-01 10:34:57,Answers,41,"<p>In isolation, there is nothing wrong with using for-in on arrays. For-in iterates over the property names of an object, and in the case of an ""out-of-the-box"" array, the properties corresponds to the array indexes. (The built-in propertes like <code>length</code>, <code>toString</code> and so on are not included in the iteration.)</p>

<p>However, if your code (or the framework you are using) add custom properties to arrays or to the array prototype, then these properties will be included in the iteration, which is probably not what you want.</p>

<p>Some  JS frameworks, like Prototype modifies the Array prototype. Other frameworks like JQuery doesn't, so with JQuery you can safely use for-in.</p>

<p>If you are in doubt, you probably shouldn't use for-in. </p>

<p>An alternative way of iterating through an array is using a for-loop:</p>

<pre><code>for (var ix=0;ix&lt;arr.length;ix++) alert(ix);

<p>However, this have a different issue. The issue is that a JavaScript array can have ""holes"". If you define <code>arr</code> as:</p>

<pre><code>var arr = [""hello""];
arr[100] = ""goodbye"";
</code></pre>

<p>Then the array have two items, but a length of 101. Using for-in will yield two indexes, while the for-loop will yield 101 indexes, where the 99 has a value of <code>undefined</code>.</p>

500504,2010-11-23 21:22:54,Answers,434,"<p>The <code>for-in</code> statement by itself is not a ""bad practice"", however it can be <em>mis-used</em>, for example, to <em>iterate</em> over arrays or array-like objects.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <code>for-in</code> statement is to <em>enumerate</em> over object properties. This statement will go up in the prototype chain, also enumerating over <em>inherited</em> properties, a thing that <em>sometimes</em> is not desired.</p>

<p>Also, the order of iteration is not guaranteed by the spec., meaning that if you want to ""iterate"" an array object, with this statement you cannot be sure that the properties (array indexes) will be visited in the numeric order.</p>

<p>For example, in JScript (IE &lt;= 8), the order of enumeration even on Array objects is defined as the properties were created:</p>

<pre><code>var array = [];
array[2] = 'c';
array[1] = 'b';
array[0] = 'a';

for (var p in array) {
  //... p will be ""2"", ""1"" and ""0"" on IE
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, speaking about inherited properties, if you, for example, extend the <code>Array.prototype</code> object (like some libraries as MooTools do), that properties will be also enumerated:</p>

<pre><code>Array.prototype.last = function () { return this[this.length-1]; };

for (var p in []) { // an empty array
  // last will be enumerated
}
</code></pre>

<p>As I said before to <em>iterate</em> over arrays or array-like objects, the best thing is to use a <em>sequential loop</em>, such as a plain-old <code>for</code>/<code>while</code> loop.</p>

<p>When you want to enumerate only the <em>own properties</em> of an object (the ones that aren't inherited), you can use the <code>hasOwnProperty</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>for (var prop in obj) {
  if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
    // prop is not inherited
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And some people even recommend calling the method directly from <code>Object.prototype</code> to avoid having problems if somebody adds a property named <code>hasOwnProperty</code> to our object:</p>

<pre><code>for (var prop in obj) {
  if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, prop)) {

When you want to iterate over <em>just</em> the indexed properties of an array, the only guaranteed way to keep things semantically consistent is to use an integer index (that is, a <code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; array.length; ++i)</code> style loop).</p>

<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>

<p>That means if a browser wanted to, it could go through the properties in the order in which they were inserted.  Or in numerical order.  Or in lexical order (where ""30"" comes before ""4""!  Keep in mind all object keys -- and thus, all array indexes -- are actually strings, so that makes total sense).  It could go through them by bucket, if it implemented objects as hash tables.  Or take any of that and add ""backwards"".  A browser could even iterate <em>randomly</em> and be ECMA-262 compliant, as long as it visited each property exactly once.</p>

<p>In practice, most browsers currently like to iterate in roughly the same order.  But there's nothing saying they have to.  That's implementation specific, and could change at any time if another way was found to be far more efficient.</p>

<p>Either way, <code>for</code>...<code>in</code> carries with it no connotation of order.  If you care about order, be explicit about it and use a regular <code>for</code> loop with an index.</p>

<p><strong>Two</strong></p>

<p>Usually the order of the items in an array is important, but the for-in loop won't necessarily iterate in the right order, that's because it treats the array as an object, which is the way it is implemented in JS, and not as an array.
This seems like a small thing, but it can really screw up applications and is hard to debug.</p>

500504,2017-09-16 23:19:57,Answers,5,"<p>Using the <code>for...in</code> loop for an array is not wrong, although I can guess why someone told you that:</p>

<p>1.) There is already a higher order function, or method, that has that purpose for an array, but has more functionality and leaner syntax, called 'forEach': <code>Array.prototype.forEach(function(element, index, array) {} );</code></p>

<p>2.) Arrays always have a length, but <code>for...in</code> and <code>forEach</code> do not execute a function for any value that is <code>'undefined'</code>, only for the indexes that have a value defined. So if you only assign one value, these loops will only execute a function once, but since an array is enumerated, it will always have a length up to the highest index that has a defined value, but that length could go unnoticed when using these loops.</p>

<p>3.) The standard for loop will execute a function as many times as you define in the parameters, and since an array is numbered, it makes more sense to define how many times you want to execute a function. Unlike the other loops, the for loop can then execute a function for every index in the array, whether the value is defined or not.</p>

<p>In essence, you can use any loop, but you should remember exactly how they work. Understand the conditions upon which the different loops reiterate, their separate functionalities, and realize they will be more or less appropriate for differing scenarios. </p>

<p>Also, it may be considered a better practice to use the <code>forEach</code> method than the <code>for...in</code> loop in general, because it is easier to write and has more functionality, so you may want to get in the habit of only using this method and standard for, but your call.</p>

<p>See below that the first two loops only execute the console.log statements once, while the standard for loop executes the function as many times as specified, in this case, array.length = 6.</p>

<pre><code>var arr = [];
arr[5] = 'F';

for (var index in arr) {
console.log(index);
console.log(arr[index]);
console.log(arr)
}
// 5
// 'F'
// =&gt; (6) [undefined x 5, 6]

arr.forEach(function(element, index, arr) {
console.log(index);
console.log(element);
console.log(arr);
});
// 5
// 'F'
// =&gt; Array (6) [undefined x 5, 6]

for (var index = 0; index &lt; arr.length; index++) {
console.log(index);
console.log(arr[index]);
console.log(arr);
};
// 0
// undefined
// =&gt; Array (6) [undefined x 5, 6]

// 1
// undefined
// =&gt; Array (6) [undefined x 5, 6]

// 2
// undefined
// =&gt; Array (6) [undefined x 5, 6]

// 3
// undefined
// =&gt; Array (6) [undefined x 5, 6]

// 4
// undefined
// =&gt; Array (6) [undefined x 5, 6]

// 5

500504,2017-12-25 13:38:50,Answers,2,"<p><strong>for...in</strong> is useful when working on an object in JavaScript, but not for an Array, but still we can not say it's a wrong way, but it's not recommended, look at this example below using <strong>for...in</strong> loop:</p>

const person = {fname:""Alireza"", lname:""Dezfoolian"", age:35}; 
for (const x in person) {
    txt += person[x] + "" "";
}
console.log(txt); //Alireza Dezfoolian 35

   txt += person[x] + "" "";
}
console.log(txt); //Alireza Dezfoolian 35

<p>But let's try something, let's prototype something to <strong>Array</strong>...</p>

<pre><code>Array.prototype.someoneelse = ""someoneelse"";

const arr = new Array();
arr[0] = 'Alireza';
arr[1] = 'Dezfoolian';
arr[2] = 35;
for(x in arr) {
 txt += arr[x] + "" "";

console.log(txt); //Alireza Dezfoolian 35 someoneelse

<p>You see the <strong>someoneelse</strong>!!!... We actually looping through new Array object in this case!</p>

1149703,2014-04-15 15:07:55,Answers,9,"<p>The clever sniping in the first set of comments was very amusing, but it really depends on what you are trying to do. 
If you don't already have the correct library, then 3 lines of code (as in D. Wroblewski's answer) is perfect.
OTOH, if you already have the apache.commons library (as most large projects will), then Amar's answer is shorter.
OK, it might take you ten minutes to get the library and install it correctly (less than one if you know what you're doing). But the clock is ticking, so you may not have the time to spare.
Jarek Przygódzki had an interesting caveat--""If you don't need nested exceptions"".</p>

<p>But what if I <em>do</em> need the full stack traces, nested and all?  In that case, the secret is to use apache.common's getFullStackTrace (see <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-2.6/org/apache/commons/lang/exception/ExceptionUtils.html#getFullStackTrace%28java.lang.Throwable%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-2.6/org/apache/commons/lang/exception/ExceptionUtils.html#getFullStackTrace%28java.lang.Throwable%29</a>)</p>

There are tons of projects especially in non-Java JVM languages that really don't want to include Guava or Commons Lang just to log a stacktrace.

<p>Instead of a <code>PrintWriter</code> use a <code>SelectivePrintWriter</code>:</p>

StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();
PrintWriter pw = new SelectivePrintWriter(sw, packageNameToFilter);
e.printStackTrace(pw);
String sStackTrace = sw.toString(); 
System.out.println(sStackTrace);

    private static final String AT = ""\tat"";
    private String internal;

    public SelectivePrintWriter(Writer out, String packageOrClassName) {
        super(out);

    }

    public void println(Object obj) {
        if (obj instanceof String) {

2709821,2010-04-25 20:25:37,Answers,807,"<p>The reason you need to use <code>self.</code> is because Python does not use special syntax to refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be <em>passed</em> automatically, but not <em>received</em> automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on. That makes methods entirely the same as functions, and leaves the actual name to use up to you (although <code>self</code> is the convention, and people will generally frown at you when you use something else.) <code>self</code> is not special to the code, it's just another object.</p>
<p>Python could have done something else to distinguish normal names from attributes -- special syntax like Ruby has, or requiring declarations like C++ and Java do, or perhaps something  yet more different -- but it didn't. Python's all for making things explicit, making it obvious what's what, and although it doesn't do it entirely everywhere, it does do it for instance attributes. That's why assigning to an instance attribute needs to know what instance to assign to, and that's why it needs <code>self.</code>.</p>

<p>As in Modula-3, there are no shorthands [in Python] for referencing the object’s members from its methods: the method function is declared with an explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call.</p>
<p>Often, the first argument of a method is called self. This is nothing more than a convention: the name self has absolutely no special meaning to Python. Note, however, that by not following the convention your code may be less readable to other Python programmers, and it is also conceivable that a class browser program might be written that relies upon such a convention.</p>

<p>So the whole structure stays the same. How can me make use of this? If we assume for a moment that we hadn’t written a <code>length</code> method for our <code>Vector</code> class, we could do this:</p>

<pre><code>Vector.length_new = length_global
v = Vector(3, 4)

<p>This works because the first parameter of <code>length_global</code>, can be re-used as the <code>self</code> parameter in <code>length_new</code>. This would not be possible without an explicit <code>self</code>.</p>

<p>Another way of understanding the need for the explicit <code>self</code> is to see where Python adds some syntactical sugar. When you keep in mind, that basically, a call like</p>

<p>is internally transformed to</p>

<pre><code>Vector.length(v_instance)

2709821,2015-05-25 16:04:31,Answers,14,"<p>Python is not a language built for Object Oriented Programming, unlike Java or C++.</p>
<p>First off, methods belong to either an entire class (<em>static method</em>) or an object (instance) of the class (<em>object method</em>).</p>
<p>When calling a static method in Python, one simply writes a method with regular arguments inside it.</p>
<pre><code>class Animal():
    def staticMethod():
        print &quot;This is a static method&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>However, an object (i.e., instance) method, which requires you to make an object (i.e. instance, an Animal in this case), needs the <code>self</code> argument.</p>
<pre><code>class Animal():
    def objectMethod(self):
        print &quot;This is an object method which needs an instance of a class&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>self</code> method is also used to refer to a variable field within the class.</p>
<pre><code>class Animal():
    #animalName made in constructor
    def Animal(self):
        self.animalName = &quot;&quot;;

    def getAnimalName(self):
        return self.animalName
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>self</code> is referring to the animalName variable of the <em>entire class</em>. REMEMBER: If you have a new variable <em>created</em> within a method (called a local variable), <code>self</code> will not work. That variable exists only while that method is running. For defining fields (the variables of the entire class), you have to define them OUTSIDE the class methods.</p>

2709821,2015-06-28 05:47:02,Answers,256,"<p>When objects are instantiated, the object itself is passed into the <code>self</code> parameter.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/whCZm.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></p>
<p>Because of this, the object’s data <em>is bound to the object</em>. Below is an example of how one might like to visualize what each object’s data might look. Notice how <code>self</code> is replaced with the object's name. I'm not saying this example diagram below is wholly accurate, but it will hopefully help one visualize the use of <code>self</code>.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5daR6.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></p>
<p>The Object is passed into the <code>self</code> parameter so that the object can keep hold of its own data.</p>
<p>Although this may not be wholly accurate, think of the process of instantiating (creating <em>and</em> assigning internal values) an object like this: When an object is made, the object uses the class as a template for its (the object's) own data and methods. Without passing the object's own variable name into the <code>self</code> parameter, the attributes and methods in the class would remain a general template and would not be referenced to (belong to) the object. So, by passing the object's name into the <code>self</code> parameter, it means that if 100 objects are instantiated from the one class, each of the 100 objects can keep track of its (each object's) own data and methods.</p>
<p>Summary: Classes are general (not ultra-specific) templates that a newly created object can pass its own specific data into (without <em>necessarily</em> affecting the rest of the objects that could be created from the same class), allowing for less copy-pasted code that serves the purpose of creating many objects that have the same patterns. <code>self</code> is for specifying that a <em>specific object</em>'s data should be used instead of some other data.</p>

2709821,2015-08-27 07:31:02,Answers,5,"<p>Is because by the way python is designed the alternatives would hardly work. Python is designed to allow methods or functions to be defined in a context where both implicit <code>this</code> (a-la Java/C++) or explicit <code>@</code> (a-la ruby) wouldn't work. Let's have an example with the explicit approach with python conventions:</p>

<pre><code>def fubar(x):
    self.x = x

class C:
    frob = fubar
</code></pre>

<p>Now the <code>fubar</code> function wouldn't work since it would assume that <code>self</code> is a global variable (and in <code>frob</code> as well). The alternative would be to execute method's with a replaced global scope (where <code>self</code> is the object).</p>

<p>The implicit approach would be</p>

<pre><code>def fubar(x)
    myX = x

class C:
    frob = fubar
</code></pre>

<p>This would mean that <code>myX</code> would be interpreted as a local variable in <code>fubar</code> (and in <code>frob</code> as well). The alternative here would be to execute methods with a replaced local scope which is retained between calls, but that would remove the posibility of method local variables.</p>

<p>However the current situation works out well:</p>

<pre><code> def fubar(self, x)
     self.x = x

 class C:
     frob = fubar
</code></pre>

<p>here when called as a method <code>frob</code> will receive the object on which it's called via the <code>self</code> parameter, and <code>fubar</code> can still be called with an object as parameter and work the same (it <em>is</em> the same as <code>C.frob</code> I think).</p>

2709821,2016-01-12 18:10:32,Answers,9,"<p>I'm surprised nobody has brought up Lua. Lua also uses the 'self' variable however it can be omitted but still used. C++ does the same with 'this'. I don't see any reason to have to declare 'self' in each function but you should still be able to use it just like you can with lua and C++. For a language that prides itself on being brief it's odd that it requires you to declare the self variable.</p>

    class myClass
        def myFunc(name)
            @name = name
        end
    end

    class myClass:

<p>The first argument of every class method, including init, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self.

<p>Another thing I would like to add is, an optional <code>self</code> argument allows me to declare static methods inside a class, by not writing <code>self</code>.</p>
<p>Code examples:</p>
<pre><code>class MyClass():
    def staticMethod():
        print(&quot;This is a static method&quot;) 

    def objectMethod(self):

2709821,2019-05-23 16:32:30,Answers,1,"<h3><em><code>self</code> is inevitable.</em></h3>

<p>There was just a <a href=""https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=239003"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">question</a> should <code>self</code> be implicit or explicit.
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Guido van Rossum</code></a> resolved this question saying <a href=""https://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has-to-stay.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>self</code> has to stay</a>.</p>

<h3><em>So where the <code>self</code> live?</em></h3>

<p>If we would just stick to functional programming we would not need <code>self</code>.
Once we enter the <em>Python OOP</em> we find <code>self</code> there.</p>

<p>Here is the typical use case <code>class C</code> with the method <code>m1</code></p>

<pre><code>class C:
    def m1(self, arg):
        print(self, ' inside')
        pass

ci =C()
print(ci, ' outside')
ci.m1(None)
print(hex(id(ci))) # hex memory address
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>This program will output:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;__main__.C object at 0x000002B9D79C6CC0&gt;  outside
&lt;__main__.C object at 0x000002B9D79C6CC0&gt;  inside
0x2b9d79c6cc0
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>self</code> holds the memory address of the class instance.
<em>The purpose</em> of <code>self</code> would be to hold the reference for <em>instance methods</em> and for us to have <strong>explicit</strong> access to that reference.     </p>

<p><sub>Note there are three different types of class methods: </sub></p>

<ul>
<li><sub>static methods (read: functions), </sub></li>
<li><sub>class methods, </sub></li>

<p>When the servlet container shuts down, it unloads all web applications, invokes the <code>destroy()</code> method of all its initialized servlets and filters, and all <code>Servlet</code>, <code>Filter</code> and <code>Listener</code> instances registered via the <code>ServletContext</code> are trashed. Finally the <a href=""https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/servletcontextlistener#contextDestroyed(jakarta.servlet.ServletContextEvent)"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ServletContextListener#contextDestroyed()</code></a> will be invoked and the <code>ServletContext</code> itself will be trashed.</p>
<h2><code>HttpServletRequest</code> and <code>HttpServletResponse</code></h2>
<p>The servlet container is attached to a web server that listens for HTTP requests on a certain port number (port 8080 is usually used during development and port 80 in production). When a client (e.g. user with a web browser, or <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2793150/how-to-use-java-net-urlconnection-to-fire-and-handle-http-requests"">programmatically using <code>URLConnection</code></a>) sends an HTTP request, the servlet container creates new instances of <a href=""https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservletrequest"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>HttpServletRequest</code></a> and <a href=""https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservletresponse"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>HttpServletResponse</code></a> and passes them through any defined <code>Filter</code> in the chain and, eventually, the <code>Servlet</code> instance.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlet-filters/info"">filters</a>, the <code>doFilter()</code> method is invoked. When the servlet container's code calls <code>chain.doFilter(request, response)</code>, the request and response continue on to the next filter, or hit the servlet if there are no remaining filters.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info"">servlets</a>, the <code>service()</code> method is invoked. By default, this method determines which one of the <code>doXxx()</code> methods to invoke based off of  <code>request.getMethod()</code>. If the determined method is absent from the servlet, then an HTTP 405 error is returned in the response.</p>
<p>The request object provides access to all of the information about the HTTP request, such as its <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL"" rel=""noreferrer"">URL</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields"" rel=""noreferrer"">headers</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string"" rel=""noreferrer"">query string</a> and body. The response object provides the ability to control and send the HTTP response the way you want by, for instance, allowing you to set the headers and the body (usually with generated HTML content from a JSP file). When the HTTP response is committed and finished, both the request and response objects are recycled and made available for reuse.</p>
<h2><code>HttpSession</code></h2>
<p>When a client visits the webapp for the first time and/or the <a href=""https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpsession"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>HttpSession</code></a> is obtained for the first time via <code>request.getSession()</code>, the servlet container creates a new <code>HttpSession</code> object, generates a long and unique ID (which you can get by <code>session.getId()</code>), and stores it in the server's memory. The servlet container also sets a <a href=""https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/cookie"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Cookie</code></a> in the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header of the HTTP response with <code>JSESSIONID</code> as its name and the unique session ID as its value.</p>
<p>As per the <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2965.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTTP cookie specification</a> (a contract any decent web browser and web server must adhere to), the client (the web browser) is required to send this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie"" rel=""noreferrer"">cookie</a> back in subsequent requests in the <code>Cookie</code> header for as long as the cookie is valid (i.e. the unique ID must refer to an unexpired session and the domain and path are correct). Using your browser's built-in HTTP traffic monitor, you can verify that the cookie is valid (press F12 in Chrome / Edge / Firefox 23+ / IE9+, and check the <em>Net/Network</em> tab). The servlet container will check the <code>Cookie</code> header of every incoming HTTP request for the presence of the cookie with the name <code>JSESSIONID</code> and use its value (the session ID) to get the associated <code>HttpSession</code> from server's memory.</p>
<p>The <code>HttpSession</code> stays alive until it has been idle (i.e. not used in a request) for more than the timeout value specified in <code>&lt;session-timeout&gt;</code>, a setting in <code>web.xml</code>. The default timeout value depends on the servlet container and is usually 30 minutes. So, when the client doesn't visit the web app for longer than the time specified, the servlet container trashes the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#HTTP_session"" rel=""noreferrer"">session</a>. Every subsequent request, even with the cookie specified, will not have access to the same session anymore; the servlet container will create a new session.</p>
<p>On the client side, the session cookie remains as long as the browser instance is running (normally). Unless the browser is configured to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/36421888/5405434"">restore the last browser session</a>, when the client closes the browser instance (all tabs/windows), the session is lost on the client's side. In a new browser instance, the cookie associated with the session wouldn't exist, so it would no longer be sent. This causes an entirely new <code>HttpSession</code> to be created, with an entirely new session cookie being used.</p>
<h2>In a nutshell</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>ServletContext</code> lives for as long as the web app lives. It is shared among <em>all</em> requests in <em>all</em> sessions.</li>
<li>The <code>HttpSession</code> lives for as long as the client is interacting with the web app with the same browser instance, and the session hasn't timed out at the server side. It is shared among <em>all</em> requests in the <em>same</em> session.</li>
<li>The <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and <code>HttpServletResponse</code> live from the time the servlet receives an HTTP request from the client, until the complete response (the web page) has arrived. It is <em>not</em> shared elsewhere.</li>
<li>All <code>Servlet</code>, <code>Filter</code> and <code>Listener</code> instances live as long as the web app lives. They are shared among <em>all</em> requests in <em>all</em> sessions.</li>
<li>Any <code>attribute</code> that is defined in <code>ServletContext</code>, <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and <code>HttpSession</code> will live as long as the object in question lives. The object itself represents the &quot;scope&quot; in bean management frameworks such as JSF, CDI, Spring, etc. Those frameworks store their scoped beans as an <code>attribute</code> of its closest matching scope.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thread Safety</h2>
<p>That said, your major concern is possibly <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_safety"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>thread safety</em></a>. You should now know that servlets and filters are shared among all requests. That's the nice thing about Java, it's multithreaded and different threads (read: HTTP requests) can make use of the same instance. It would otherwise be too expensive to recreate, <code>init()</code> and <code>destroy()</code> them for every single request.</p>
<p>You should also realize that you should <strong>never</strong> assign any request or session scoped data as an <em>instance</em> variable of a servlet or filter. It will be shared among all other requests in other sessions. That's <strong>not</strong> thread-safe! The below example illustrates this:</p>
<pre><code>public class ExampleServlet extends HttpServlet {

    private Object thisIsNOTThreadSafe;

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        Object thisIsThreadSafe;

        thisIsNOTThreadSafe = request.getParameter(&quot;foo&quot;); // BAD!! Shared among all requests!
        thisIsThreadSafe = request.getParameter(&quot;foo&quot;); // OK, this is thread safe.
    } 
}
</code></pre>

3106452,2012-02-22 12:54:18,Answers,33,"<p>When the servlet container (like Apache Tomcat) starts up, it will read from the web.xml file (only one per application) if anything goes wrong or shows up an error at container side console, otherwise, it will deploy and load all web applications by using web.xml (so named it as deployment descriptor).</p>
<p>During instantiation phase of the servlet, servlet instance is ready but it cannot serve the client request because it is missing with two pieces of information:<br />
1: context information<br />
2: initial configuration information</p>
<p>Servlet engine creates servletConfig interface object encapsulating the above missing information into it
servlet engine calls init() of the servlet by supplying servletConfig object references as an argument. Once init() is completely executed servlet is ready to serve the client request.</p>
<h3>Q) In the lifetime of servlet how many times instantiation and initialization happens ??</h3>
<p>A)only once (for every client request a new thread is created)
only one instance of the servlet serves any number of the client request ie, after serving one client request server does not die. It waits for other client requests ie what CGI (for every client request a new process is created) limitation is overcome with the servlet (internally servlet engine creates the thread).</p>
<h3>Q)How session concept works?</h3>
<p>A)whenever getSession() is called on HttpServletRequest object</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: request object is evaluated for incoming session ID.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: if ID not available a brand new HttpSession object is created and its corresponding session ID is generated (ie of HashTable) session ID is stored into httpservlet response object and the reference of HttpSession object is returned to the servlet (doGet/doPost).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: if ID available brand new session object is not created session ID is picked up from the request object search is made in the collection of sessions by using session ID as the key.</p>
<p>Once the search is successful session ID is stored into HttpServletResponse and the existing session object references are returned to the doGet() or doPost() of UserDefineservlet.</p>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>1)when control leaves from servlet code to client don't forget that session object is being held by servlet container ie, the servlet engine</p>
<p>2)multithreading is left to servlet developers people for implementing ie., handle the multiple requests of client nothing to bother about multithread code</p>
<h3>Inshort form:</h3>
<p>A servlet is created when the application starts (it is deployed on the servlet container) or when it is first accessed (depending on the load-on-startup setting)
when the servlet is instantiated, the init() method of the servlet is called
then the servlet (its one and only instance) handles all requests (its service() method being called by multiple threads). That's why it is not advisable to have any synchronization in it, and you should avoid instance variables of the servlet
when the application is undeployed (the servlet container stops), the destroy() method is called.</p>

3106452,2014-03-05 11:41:57,Answers,13,"<p>The Servlet Specification <strong>JSR-315</strong> clearly defines the web container behavior in the service (and doGet, doPost, doPut etc.) methods (2.3.3.1 Multithreading Issues, Page 9):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A servlet container may send concurrent requests through the service
  method of the servlet. To handle the requests, the Servlet Developer
  must make adequate provisions for concurrent processing with multiple
  threads in the service method.</p>
  
  <p>Although it is not recommended, an alternative for the Developer is to
  implement the SingleThreadModel interface which requires the container
  to guarantee that there is only one request thread at a time in the
  service method. A servlet container may satisfy this requirement by
  serializing requests on a servlet, or by maintaining a pool of servlet
  instances. If the servlet is part of a Web application that has been
  marked as distributable, the container may maintain a pool of servlet
  instances in each JVM that the application is distributed across.</p>
  
  <p>For servlets not implementing the SingleThreadModel interface, if the
  service method (or methods such as doGet or doPost which are
  dispatched to the service method of the HttpServlet abstract class)
  has been defined with the synchronized keyword, the servlet container

  through it. It is strongly recommended that Developers not synchronize
  the service method (or methods dispatched to it) in these
  circumstances because of detrimental effects on performance</p>

<p>There's no <code>null</code> in Python; instead there's <code>None</code>. As stated already, the most accurate way to test that something has been given <code>None</code> as a value is to use the <code>is</code> identity operator, which tests that two variables refer to the same object.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo is None
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = 'bar'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo is None
False
</code></pre>
<h1>The basics</h1>
<h2>There is and can only be one <code>None</code></h2>
<p><code>None</code> is the sole instance of the class <code>NoneType</code> and any further attempts at instantiating that class will return the same object, which makes <code>None</code> a singleton. Newcomers to Python often see error messages that mention <code>NoneType</code> and wonder what it is. It's my personal opinion that these messages could simply just mention <code>None</code> by name because, as we'll see shortly, <code>None</code> leaves little room to ambiguity. So if you see some <code>TypeError</code> message that mentions that <code>NoneType</code> can't do this or can't do that, just know that it's simply the one <code>None</code> that was being used in a way that it can't.</p>
<p>Also, <code>None</code> is a built-in constant. As soon as you start Python, it's available to use from everywhere, whether in module, class, or function. <code>NoneType</code> by contrast is not, you'd need to get a reference to it first by querying <code>None</code> for its class.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; NoneType
NameError: name 'NoneType' is not defined

<p>You can check <code>None</code>'s uniqueness with Python's identity function <code>id()</code>. It returns the unique number assigned to an object, each object has one. If the id of two variables is the same, then they point in fact to the same object.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; NoneType = type(None)
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(None)
10748000
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_none = NoneType()
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(my_none)
10748000
&gt;&gt;&gt; another_none = NoneType()
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(another_none)
10748000
&gt;&gt;&gt; def function_that_does_nothing(): pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; return_value = function_that_does_nothing()
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(return_value)
10748000
</code></pre>
<h2><code>None</code> cannot be overwritten</h2>
<p>In much older versions of Python (before 2.4) it was possible to reassign <code>None</code>, but not any more. Not even as a class attribute or in the confines of a function.</p>
<pre><code># In Python 2.7
&gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeClass(object):
...     def my_fnc(self):
...             self.None = 'foo'
SyntaxError: cannot assign to None
&gt;&gt;&gt; def my_fnc():
        None = 'foo'
SyntaxError: cannot assign to None

# In Python 3.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeClass:
...     def my_fnc(self):
...             self.None = 'foo'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&gt;&gt;&gt; def my_fnc():
        None = 'foo'
SyntaxError: cannot assign to keyword
</code></pre>
<p>It's therefore safe to assume that all <code>None</code> references are the same. There isn't any &quot;custom&quot; <code>None</code>.</p>
<h2>To test for <code>None</code> use the <code>is</code> operator</h2>
<p>When writing code you might be tempted to test for <em>Noneness</em> like this:</p>
<pre><code>if value==None:
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Or to test for falsehood like this</p>
<pre><code>if not value:
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>You need to understand the implications and why it's often a good idea to be explicit.</p>
<h3>Case 1: testing if a value is <code>None</code></h3>
<p>Why do</p>
<pre><code>value is None
</code></pre>
<p>rather than</p>
<pre><code>value==None
</code></pre>
<p>?</p>
<p>The first is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>id(value)==id(None)
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas the expression <code>value==None</code> is in fact applied like this</p>
<pre><code>value.__eq__(None)
</code></pre>
<p>If the value really is <code>None</code> then you'll get what you expected.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing = function_that_does_nothing()
&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing.__eq__(None)
True
</code></pre>
<p>In most common cases the outcome will be the same, but the <code>__eq__()</code> method opens a door that voids any guarantee of accuracy, since it can be overridden in a class to provide special behavior.</p>
<p>Consider this class.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Empty(object):
...     def __eq__(self, other):
...         return not other
</code></pre>
<p>So you try it on <code>None</code> and it works</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; empty = Empty()
&gt;&gt;&gt; empty==None
True
</code></pre>
<p>But then it also works on the empty string</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; empty==''
True
</code></pre>
<p>And yet</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ''==None
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; empty is None
False
</code></pre>
<h3>Case 2: Using <code>None</code> as a boolean</h3>
<p>The following two tests</p>
<pre><code>if value:
    # Do something

if not value:
    # Do something
</code></pre>
<p>are in fact evaluated as</p>
<pre><code>if bool(value):
    # Do something

if not bool(value):
    # Do something
</code></pre>
<p><code>None</code> is a &quot;falsey&quot;, meaning that if cast to a boolean it will return <code>False</code> and if applied the <code>not</code> operator it will return <code>True</code>. Note however that it's not a property unique to <code>None</code>. In addition to <code>False</code> itself, the property is shared by empty lists, tuples, sets, dicts, strings, as well as 0, and all objects from classes that implement the <code>__bool__()</code> magic method to return <code>False</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; bool(None)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; not None
True

&gt;&gt;&gt; bool([])
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; not []
True

&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyFalsey(object):
...     def __bool__(self):
...         return False
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = MyFalsey()
&gt;&gt;&gt; bool(f)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; not f
True
</code></pre>
<p>So when testing for variables in the following way, be extra aware of what you're including or excluding from the test:</p>
<pre><code>def some_function(value=None):
    if not value:
        value = init_value()
</code></pre>
<p>In the above, did you mean to call <code>init_value()</code> when the value is set specifically to <code>None</code>, or did you mean that a value set to <code>0</code>, or the empty string, or an empty list should also trigger the initialization? Like I said, be mindful. As it's often the case, in Python <em>explicit is better than implicit</em>.</p>
<h1><code>None</code> in practice</h1>
<h2><code>None</code> used as a signal value</h2>
<p><code>None</code> has a special status in Python. It's a favorite baseline value because many algorithms treat it as an exceptional value. In such scenarios it can be used as a flag to signal that a condition requires some special handling (such as the setting of a default value).</p>
<p>You can assign <code>None</code> to the keyword arguments of a function and then explicitly test for it.</p>
<pre><code>def my_function(value, param=None):
    if param is None:
        # Do something outrageous!
</code></pre>
<p>You can return it as the default when trying to get to an object's attribute and then explicitly test for it before doing something special.</p>
<pre><code>value = getattr(some_obj, 'some_attribute', None)
if value is None:
    # do something spectacular!
</code></pre>
<p>By default a dictionary's <code>get()</code> method returns <code>None</code> when trying to access a non-existing key:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; some_dict = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; value = some_dict.get('foo')
&gt;&gt;&gt; value is None
True
</code></pre>
<p>If you were to try to access it by using the subscript notation a <code>KeyError</code> would be raised</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; value = some_dict['foo']
KeyError: 'foo'
</code></pre>
<p>Likewise if you attempt to pop a non-existing item</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; value = some_dict.pop('foo')
KeyError: 'foo'
</code></pre>
<p>which you can suppress with a default value that is usually set to <code>None</code></p>
<pre><code>value = some_dict.pop('foo', None)
if value is None:
    # Booom!
</code></pre>
<h2><code>None</code> used as both a flag and valid value</h2>
<p>The above described uses of <code>None</code> apply when it is not considered a valid value, but more like a signal to do something special. There are situations however where it sometimes matters to know where <code>None</code> came from because even though it's used as a signal it could also be part of the data.</p>
<p>When you query an object for its attribute with <code>getattr(some_obj, 'attribute_name', None)</code> getting back <code>None</code> doesn't tell you if the attribute you were trying to access was set to <code>None</code> or if it was altogether absent from the object. The same situation when accessing a key from a dictionary, like <code>some_dict.get('some_key')</code>, you don't know if <code>some_dict['some_key']</code> is missing or if it's just set to <code>None</code>. If you need that information, the usual way to handle this is to directly attempt accessing the attribute or key from within a <code>try/except</code> construct:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    # Equivalent to getattr() without specifying a default
    # value = getattr(some_obj, 'some_attribute')
    value = some_obj.some_attribute
    # Now you handle `None` the data here
    if value is None:
        # Do something here because the attribute was set to None
except AttributeError:
    # We're now handling the exceptional situation from here.
    # We could assign None as a default value if required.
    value = None
    # In addition, since we now know that some_obj doesn't have the
    # attribute 'some_attribute' we could do something about that.
    log_something(some_obj)
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly with dict:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    value = some_dict['some_key']
    if value is None:
        # Do something here because 'some_key' is set to None
except KeyError:
    # Set a default
    value = None
    # And do something because 'some_key' was missing
    # from the dict.
    log_something(some_dict)
</code></pre>
<p>The above two examples show how to handle object and dictionary cases. What about functions? The same thing, but we use the double asterisks keyword argument to that end:</p>
<pre><code>def my_function(**kwargs):
    try:
        value = kwargs['some_key']
        if value is None:
            # Do something because 'some_key' is explicitly
            # set to None
    except KeyError:
        # We assign the default
        value = None
        # And since it's not coming from the caller.
        log_something('did not receive &quot;some_key&quot;')
</code></pre>
<h2><code>None</code> used only as a valid value</h2>
<p>If you find that your code is littered with the above <code>try/except</code> pattern simply to differentiate between <code>None</code> flags and <code>None</code> data, then just use another test value. There's a pattern where a value that falls outside the set of valid values is inserted as part of the data in a data structure and is used to control and test special conditions (e.g. boundaries, state, etc.). Such a value is called a <em>sentinel</em> and it can be used the way <code>None</code> is used as a signal. It's trivial to create a sentinel in Python.</p>
<pre><code>undefined = object()
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>undefined</code> object above is unique and doesn't do much of anything that might be of interest to a program, it's thus an excellent replacement for <code>None</code> as a flag. Some caveats apply, more about that after the code.</p>
<p>With function</p>
<pre><code>def my_function(value, param1=undefined, param2=undefined):
    if param1 is undefined:
        # We know nothing was passed to it, not even None
        log_something('param1 was missing')
        param1 = None


    if param2 is undefined:
        # We got nothing here either
        log_something('param2 was missing')
        param2 = None
</code></pre>
<p>With dict</p>
<pre><code>value = some_dict.get('some_key', undefined)
if value is None:
    log_something(&quot;'some_key' was set to None&quot;)

if value is undefined:
    # We know that the dict didn't have 'some_key'
    log_something(&quot;'some_key' was not set at all&quot;)
    value = None
</code></pre>
<p>With an object</p>
<pre><code>value = getattr(obj, 'some_attribute', undefined)
if value is None:
    log_something(&quot;'obj.some_attribute' was set to None&quot;)
if value is undefined:
    # We know that there's no obj.some_attribute
    log_something(&quot;no 'some_attribute' set on obj&quot;)
    value = None
</code></pre>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, custom sentinels come with some caveats. First, they're not keywords like <code>None</code>, so Python doesn't protect them. You can overwrite your <code>undefined</code> above at any time, anywhere in the module it's defined, so be careful how you expose and use them. Next, the instance returned by <code>object()</code> is not a singleton. If you make that call 10 times you get 10 different objects. Finally, usage of a sentinel is highly idiosyncratic. A sentinel is specific to the library it's used in and as such its scope should generally be limited to the library's internals. It shouldn't &quot;leak&quot; out. External code should only become aware of it, if their purpose is to extend or supplement the library's API.</p>

<p>However, often creating copies of only slightly altered dictionaries is probably not a good idea because it will result in comparatively large memory demands. It is usually better to log the old dictionary(if even necessary) and then modify it.</p>

Is there a way to delete an element from a dictionary in Python?

I know I can just call `.pop` on the dictionary, but that returns the element that was removed. What I'm looking for is something returns the dictionary *minus* the element in question. 

At present I have a helper function that accepts the dictionary in question as parameter, and then returns a dictionary with the element removed, Is there a more elegant solution?"

Therefore it alters the _reference_ to the dictionary that was passed from the caller to the ""helper function"". So the ""helper function"" doesn't need to return anything, since the original reference to the dictionary in the caller will already be altered. Don't assign the return from `dict.pop()` to anything if you don't need it. EG: `do stuff with my_dict; my_dict.pop(my_key, None); do more stuff with my_dict # now doesn't have my_key`.

<p>You can use both <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.pop"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>dict.pop()</code></a> method and a more generic <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#the-del-statement"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>del</code> statement</a> to remove items from a dictionary. They both mutate the original dictionary, so you need to make a copy (see details below).</p>

<p><strong>And both of them will raise a <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyError"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>KeyError</code></a> if the key you're providing to them is not present in the dictionary:</strong></p>

<pre><code>key_to_remove = ""c""
d = {""a"": 1, ""b"": 2}
del d[key_to_remove]  # Raises `KeyError: 'c'`
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>key_to_remove = ""c""
d = {""a"": 1, ""b"": 2}
d.pop(key_to_remove)  # Raises `KeyError: 'c'`
</code></pre>

<p>You have to take care of this:</p>

<p><strong>by capturing the exception:</strong></p>

<pre><code>key_to_remove = ""c""
d = {""a"": 1, ""b"": 2}
try:
    del d[key_to_remove]
except KeyError as ex:
    print(""No such key: '%s'"" % ex.message)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>key_to_remove = ""c""
d = {""a"": 1, ""b"": 2}
try:
    d.pop(key_to_remove)
except KeyError as ex:
    print(""No such key: '%s'"" % ex.message)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>by performing a check:</strong></p>

<pre><code>key_to_remove = ""c""
d = {""a"": 1, ""b"": 2}
if key_to_remove in d:
    del d[key_to_remove]
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>key_to_remove = ""c""
d = {""a"": 1, ""b"": 2}
if key_to_remove in d:
    d.pop(key_to_remove)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>but with <code>pop()</code> there's also a much more concise way - provide the default return value:</strong></p>

<pre><code>key_to_remove = ""c""
d = {""a"": 1, ""b"": 2}
d.pop(key_to_remove, None)  # No `KeyError` here
</code></pre>

<p>Unless you use <code>pop()</code> to get the value of a key being removed you may provide anything, not necessary <code>None</code>.
Though it might be that using <code>del</code> with <code>in</code> check is <strong>slightly</strong> faster due to <code>pop()</code> being a function with its own complications causing overhead. Usually it's not the case, so <code>pop()</code> with default value is good enough.</p>

<hr>

<p>As for the main question, you'll have to make a copy of your dictionary, to save the original dictionary and have a new one without the key being removed.</p>

<p>Some other people here suggest making a full (deep) copy with <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html?#copy.deepcopy"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>copy.deepcopy()</code></a>, which might be an overkill, a ""normal"" (shallow) copy, using <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html?#copy.copy"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>copy.copy()</code></a> or <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.copy"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>dict.copy()</code></a>, might be enough. The dictionary keeps a reference to the object as a value for a key. So when you remove a key from a dictionary this reference is removed, not the object being referenced. The object itself may be removed later automatically by the garbage collector, if there're no other references for it in the memory. Making a deep copy requires more calculations compared to shallow copy, so it decreases code performance by making the copy, wasting memory and providing more work to the GC, sometimes shallow copy is enough.</p>

<p>However, if you have mutable objects as dictionary values and plan to modify them later in the returned dictionary without the key, you have to make a deep copy.</p>

<p><strong>With shallow copy:</strong></p>

<pre><code>def get_dict_wo_key(dictionary, key):
    """"""Returns a **shallow** copy of the dictionary without a key.""""""
    _dict = dictionary.copy()

  <p>… how can I delete an item from a dictionary to return a copy (i.e., not modifying the original)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <code>dict</code> is the wrong data structure to use for this.</p>

<p>Sure, copying the dict and popping from the copy works, and so does building a new dict with a comprehension, but all that copying takes time—you've replaced a constant-time operation with a linear-time one. And all those copies alive at once take space—linear space per copy.</p>

<p>Other data structures, like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie"" rel=""noreferrer"">hash array mapped tries</a>, are designed for exactly this kind of use case: adding or removing an element returns a copy <em>in logarithmic time, sharing most of its storage with the original</em>.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Of course there are some downsides. Performance is logarithmic rather than constant (although with a large base, usually 32-128). And, while you can make the non-mutating API identical to <code>dict</code>, the ""mutating"" API is obviously different. And, most of all, there's no HAMT batteries included with Python.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://pypi.org/project/pyrsistent/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>pyrsistent</code></a> library is a pretty solid implementation of HAMT-based dict-replacements (and various other types) for Python. It even has a nifty <a href=""http://pyrsistent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#evolvers"" rel=""noreferrer"">evolver API</a> for porting existing mutating code to persistent code as smoothly as possible. But if you want to be explicit about returning copies rather than mutating, you just use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from pyrsistent import m
&gt;&gt;&gt; d1 = m(a=1, b=2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = d1.set('c', 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d3 = d1.remove('a')
&gt;&gt;&gt; d1
pmap({'a': 1, 'b': 2})
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2
pmap({'c': 3, 'a': 1, 'b': 2})
&gt;&gt;&gt; d3
pmap({'b': 2})
</code></pre>

<p>That <code>d3 = d1.remove('a')</code> is exactly what the question is asking for.</p>

<p>If you've got mutable data structures like <code>dict</code> and <code>list</code> embedded in the <code>pmap</code>, you'll still have aliasing issues—you can only fix that by going immutable all the way down, embedding <code>pmap</code>s and <code>pvector</code>s.</p>

<hr>

<p><sub>1. HAMTs have also become popular in languages like Scala, Clojure, Haskell because they play very nicely with lock-free programming and software transactional memory, but neither of those is very relevant in Python.</sub></p>

<p><sub>2. In fact, there <em>is</em> an HAMT in the stdlib, used in the implementation of <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/contextvars.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>contextvars</code></a>. <a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0550/#appendix-hamt-performance-analysis"" rel=""noreferrer"">The earlier withdrawn PEP explains why.</a> But this is a hidden implementation detail of the library, not a public collection type.</sub></p>

  // Turn your strings into dates, and then subtract them
  // to get a value that is either negative, positive, or zero.
  return new Date(b.date) - new Date(a.date);

<h2>More Generic Answer</h2>

<pre><code>array.sort(function(o1,o2){
  if (sort_o1_before_o2)    return -1;
  else if(sort_o1_after_o2) return  1;
  else                      return  0;

<pre><code>array.sort(function(o1,o2){
  return sort_o1_before_o2 ? -1 : sort_o1_after_o2 ? 1 : 0;
});
</code></pre>

<h2>Generic, Powerful Answer</h2>

<p>Define a custom non-enumerable <code>sortBy</code> function using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform"">Schwartzian transform</a> on all arrays :</p>

<pre><code>(function(){
  if (typeof Object.defineProperty === 'function'){
    try{Object.defineProperty(Array.prototype,'sortBy',{value:sb}); }catch(e){}
  }
  if (!Array.prototype.sortBy) Array.prototype.sortBy = sb;

  function sb(f){
    for (var i=this.length;i;){
      var o = this[--i];
      this[i] = [].concat(f.call(o,o,i),o);
    }
    this.sort(function(a,b){
      for (var i=0,len=a.length;i&lt;len;++i){
        if (a[i]!=b[i]) return a[i]&lt;b[i]?-1:1;
      }
      return 0;
    });
    for (var i=this.length;i;){
      this[--i]=this[i][this[i].length-1];
    }
    return this;
  }
})();
</code></pre>

<p>Use it like so:</p>

<pre><code>array.sortBy(function(o){ return o.date });
</code></pre>

<p>If your date is not directly comparable, make a comparable date out of it, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>array.sortBy(function(o){ return new Date( o.date ) });
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use this to sort by multiple criteria if you return an array of values:</p>

<pre><code>// Sort by date, then score (reversed), then name
array.sortBy(function(o){ return [ o.date, -o.score, o.name ] };
</code></pre>

sortBy(data, {
    prop: &quot;date&quot;,
    desc: true,
    parser: function (item) {
        //ignore case sensitive
        return item.toUpperCase();

<p>If you want to treat the &quot;date&quot; field as <code>Date</code> type:</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>//sort the object by a property (ascending)
//sorting parses each item to Date type
sortBy(data, {
    prop: &quot;date&quot;,

How can I sort this array by the date element in order from the date closest to the current date and time down? Keep in mind that the array may have many objects, but for the sake of simplicity I used 2.

Would I use the sort function and a custom comparator?

**UPDATE:**

In my specific case, I wanted the dates arranged from the most recent to the oldest. It ended up that I had to reverse the simple function's logic as so:

    array.sort(function(a, b) {
		a = new Date(a.dateModified);
		b = new Date(b.dateModified);
		return a>b ? -1 : a<b ? 1 : 0;

This sorts the dates from the most recent."

<p>Since time does not exists with the above dates, the Date object will consider following default time for sorting:</p>
